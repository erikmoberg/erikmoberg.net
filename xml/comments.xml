      <message>Nice review! I really is a pretty decent phone. &#xD;
I am a bit shocked by a max of 2 days battery life, though. My HTC Magic can make 3 days if I don't use it much.&#xD;
Totally agree on the crappy music player that comes with it - I recently installed Mort Player (free), which seems to be a lot better.</message>

      <message>About battery life: I learned it the hard way after the phone died on me - after just some 36 hours of usage. NES emulation seems to need a lot of juice. YMMV, as always.&#xD;
&#xD;
I also use and can warmly recommend the Mort Player. Look at the picture of the phone in this review - the upper right shortcut actually points to Mort and not the default player (you can tell by the icon).</message>

      <message>Emulation is a battery hog. Usually the emulator is written in a way that it doesn't sleep at all and is running the emulated CPU etc. all the time. &#xD;
I don't know what the official standby time is but the journalist tech geeks seems to charge their cellphones every evening.&#xD;
Only android 1.6... that ain't new... but it may be easier on the batteries with less features.</message>

      <message>Just to make things clear, an Android 2.1 update is available for this phone since several months back and it is working well. It does not slow down the phone (noticeably) and it fixes some problems - some web pages not working properly in the browser before now show up as expected, for example.</message>

      <message>Hey man, graet review. I just have 1 question. You say the Plantronic one is not chargable while using it. Is that becuase of the range of the USB cable or the fact that it has no power in it while its battery is dead? I mean if I were to buy a longer miniusb to usb cable and the headset died, could I plug that on in, w8 10 min and use it while being charge?&#xD;
&#xD;
Thanks fpr reading // Hab</message>

      <message>Sorry for taking so long time replying to this, but better late than never I guess. Fact is, the headset cannot be used when charging at all, it basically stays switched off while charging. The Creative headset does not suffer from this.</message>

      <message>Hi Don,&#xD;
&#xD;
there are a few things you can do to make sure things are set up properly. A common problem is that Windows is sending sound to the wrong device, since the OS can only direct sound output to one device at a time.&#xD;
&#xD;
After connecting the USB dongle and having turned on the headset, right click the speaker icon next to the Windows clock and select "Playback devices". The headset should show up in the list. Now, select the headset and click the "Set Default" button (or select "Default communication device" if you only want to use it with Skype and the like). Click "Properties" and make sure the volume is not set to zero (under the "Levels" tab).&#xD;
&#xD;
For mic setup, just select "Recording devices" instead of "Playback devices" and you will be able to figure out the rest.&#xD;
&#xD;
The changes should take effect immediately, but in some cases you may have to restart the application playing sounds (Windows Media Player, Skype or whatever).&#xD;
&#xD;
If this doesn't help, try using the headset with another PC.</message>

&#xD;
according to Plantronics, the dongle does not support multipoint. Thus, it is only possible to connect one headset, not two.</message>

      <message>Nicely done! I have tried this to, but only with one long exposure. They are - as you probably know - not that good. Even at ISO100 is there a lot of grain and all those annoying hot pixels on the sensor are visible. And just as you&#xB4;ve written will parts of the image be overexposed by the surrounding city lights. I don&#xB4;t have a remote shutter (besides the IR) and will thus keep this project in mind for the future.</message>

      <message>Well, I'm not sure rooting it will really solve any of the inherent limitations of 2.1 - the lack of flash support is a major flaw, and I have yet to find a working solution.&#xD;

But rooting is fun, so why not? I recommend you head over to the nice people at android tablets, they have a lot of good tips:&#xD;

      <message>To use the keyboard, you need to activate USB Host mode. Go to Settings, select "USB Mode Select" and tick "Host Mode". The keyboard (or other USB devices, like USB sticks) can now be connected.&#xD;
&#xD;
After a reboot, the setting is reset and need to be reactivated. Apparently, it draws a lot of power so this should be a "good thing".</message>

      <message>Hi Julie,&#xD;
&#xD;
tough one. I had zero problems setting mine up. The router was set to use WPA2 with AES and a pre-shared key. My network showed up in the list (Wireless &amp; network settings), I chose it, left security to auto, entered password and it just worked.&#xD;
&#xD;
I would do the usual things; reboot the router, play around a bit with the security settings (on both ends), and, if nothing helps, try the tablet on a friend's network. Maybe the tablet just doesn't play nice with your router. Also, I have heard that there are compatibility issues between some 802.11n devices, 802.11b/g (slower/older router) should be fine though. &#xD;
&#xD;
Hope this helps.</message>

I'm afraid I will have to disappoint you. I don't have the firmware for 741, neither do I know which one it uses or how to acquire it. If it's under warranty, just exchange for a new one.&#xD;
&#xD;
If that is not an option, you can find a lot of information on how to install firmware/fixing bricked tablets here:&#xD;

&#xD;
to clear the history, open the browser and tap the menu button (top right of the screen, as always). From the menu, tap "more", then "Settings". Scroll down to "Privacy". From here, cache, history and cookies can be deleted.&#xD;
&#xD;
Google also saves your search history, which you can delete separately. From the Google start page, tap the "Settings" link. Scroll down to "Search history" and tap "Clear saved searches".&#xD;

Hope this helps.</message>

&#xD;
I am not familiar with the AK Notepad myself, but I guess it's possible that it just doesn't work on the SmartPad. This just tends to happen sometimes - it is a quite cheap product with almost zero support, after all. I'm afraid the only tip I can give you is to reinstall the app, and if that doesn't work, try to find an alternative (there should be plenty).</message>

      <message>Hi Kate,&#xD;
&#xD;
sure thing! (Assuming you mean Kindle.) Just use the ASK and open the Android Market, then search for "Amazon Kindle" or something similar. The official Kindle app should show up. Download and install, then start the application. Log on with your Amazon username and password, and you are good to go. They have a few free samples (classics like Dracula or Pride and Prejudice) that you can try first.&#xD;
&#xD;
The application runs just fine on the ASK, maybe a bit sluggish when flipping but perfectly acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
Have fun!</message>

      <message>Hi Erik, &#xD;
I found the tablet turns itself back on very often. It uses more battery. I only installed Aldiko as my bookreader and  juice defender. I couldn't work out what cause the problem.&#xD;
Any idea?</message>

      <message>Hi Lilac,&#xD;
&#xD;
weird problem. My tablet only turns itself on when I plug in the charger, which seems to be a "feature". If you feel bored, you might try a factory reset, it's always a blast. ;)</message>

I have not been able to resolve this issue. Skype on Android is still immature and crashes on many devices (it works great on my SonyEricsson X10 Mini Pro though). Just keep updating to the latest version, I hope they will have these issues sorted out soon.</message>

      <message>I also bought a 3gSmart pad from HK. It is okay to play games and read books but the battery life is only about 1 hour. There was a message sent to it to say to click here and upgrade your battery life which I did. I have downloaded the file and it is in the book marks but now I can't find where the bookmarks are&#xD;

Android 2.3 to 3.0 upgrade is available for ASK 741SP.&#xD;
I've dropped off the device to the local technical support center 2 weeks ago...approved the wifi connection as well &#xD;
***Required to drop off the smartpad for at least 3-5 days/Technician works part-time; therefore, expect pick up the other days later***</message>

      <message>Hi mark,&#xD;
&#xD;
I'm not quite sure what you mean. If it does not boot up at all and you just got it, it may be a hardware of firmware problem. Try contacting the shop where you bought it to see if you can get a new one. By the way, a corrupt firmware can usually be fixed by downloading the latest one from the manufacturer and extracting it to the root of the SD card. I'm afraid I don't know where to get the firmware though. Try contacting ASK. Their home page address is:&#xD;

 &#xD;
and thanks for your interest in this article. Now, you did link to a Honeycomb system image which I highly doubt will work right off the bat for the SmartPad. To avoid people bricking their devices, I removed the download link. Please let me know (using the contact form) if you have successfully updated the device to 3.0 using the image. If so, I apologize and will re-add the link.</message>

you can find instructions in doing a factory reset here:&#xD;

BTW: A regular reset, that is, restarting the unit if it freezes, is simply done by inserting a pin into the hole marked "Reset" next to the power button.</message>

not sure there is one! It should work just like any "standard" Android 4.0 device though, so if you are having specific questions about the software, googling it should do it. Plenty of forums and blogs around with info on Android 4.0. Otherwise, just contact ASK directly: &#xD;

sorry for the late reply... and for not having an answer! I have a Gemei G9 tablet, and I have never gotten  the HDMI port on it to work. Apparently, just connecting it to the TV and switching TV to the correct HDMI port should do it. Maybe another TV and cable would solve it?</message>

      <message>@mona: Not sure about the 755SP, but many tablet can be charger using a special USB cable (usually provided), but also using the regular mini/micro-USB (sync) port. So if one does not work, try the other one. 

@Mehrad: Possibly, the countries use different standards. But I know very little about this, feel free to post back here if you manage to solve it.</message>

Get an extra strap and fasten to your tripod aswell. It isn&#xB4;t perfect but it makes life a bit easier.&#xD;

Something I wanted to add, I have a nikon d700 and I think all nikon's have on their sides triangular "keychains" placed to attach your strap. I managed to place my hook directly on it, eliminating the need for the tripod base.&#xD;

      <message>Hi Karina,&#xD;
&#xD;
it's quite simple actually - for folding instructions, just follow the link:&#xD;
&#xD;
http://www.coolopticalillusions.com/illusions/coolprinttriangle.pdf&#xD;
&#xD;
I found using a fairly a long lens (&gt;100mm) helps "flatten" the look of the triangle. Getting the right angle is critical. Put the triangle on the floor or on a table and walk around it to find the right spot. Mount the camera on a tripod there. The tripod helps, since you can make small adjustments to the angle and composition without having to start over every time. Hand-holding gets very tiresome. Keep shooting and adjusting until you get it right.</message>

      <message>Decent run down of the device.  Sorry to hear you have had some of those build quality type issues, but glad to hear it is workable for you.  In regards to your article here are some things that may you or your readers out.&#xD;
1) Head on over to SlateDroid.com Forums.&#xD;
 - You will find plenty of threads and support for the Gemei G9 in it's own section&#xD;
2) Download the ICS firmware posted there and install it&#xD;
3) Run the "SuperScript" and you can open up the market and compatibility along with rooting and tweaking.&#xD;
&#xD;
In regards to Skype, there is a fully working previous version 2.5.x.x posted in a separate thread that you can download and install to have working video both ways.&#xD;
&#xD;
The battery life on the device is already great, but can be made even better by downloading SetCPU and following the settings guide thread in the Benchmark section of SlateDroid.&#xD;
&#xD;
Keep up the good work!&#xD;

      <message>Awesome comparison between the Canon EOS 600D and 1000D! I just wanted to leave a quick comment to let you know about our awesome gadget for photographers of every level. :) The Hufa Holder lens cap clip was designed by photographers after they had, like many other photographers do, lost a TON of lens caps. The nifty little device just clips right on your strap and keeps your cap in place while you're shooting! Turns out, we lose a whole lot less lens caps this way! :) This also works no matter what camera you are using. Here is a video for you to check it out http://bit.ly/Nu7FPx. Thanks again for sharing your Canon EOS comparison! Hope you'll check out our gadget when you get a chance.&#xD;

Have a great day,&#xD;

I usually don't tolerate advertising disguised as comments, but the item seems fairly nifty so I'll let it slip. However, I have been using my DSLR for over three years and I have never lost a lens cap.</message>

      <message>Thanks for sharing this review. This has helped me a lot. I have a 1000d and was thinking of upgrading the body, but have decided to stay put with 1000d since I shoot only using optical viewfinder and the center focus point, and usually in daylight. At night I use the 50mm 1.8 so I don't need to use a higher ISO. I will spend the money on a wide angle lens instead and work on my composition skills.

I think the only thing that would have really helped me is Spot Metering, and a faster shutter speed - but I will try to make do with the Partial Metering for now.</message>

      <message>I just had the same problem in my canon 550D. My 50mm 1.8 II fell on the ground. I did not check it after that and inserted it into the camera. The lens stuck in the camera. After few attempts I forced the lens and end up with the same result you show on the picture. Happy that my camera is woking perfectly without a problem.</message>

sorry to hear you had the same problem, but happy you solved it without any nasty side effects! I noticed that my camera has started to sporadically have problems communicating with some lenses afterwards - seems like the pins inside the mount took a beating. :(</message>

&#xD;
let me put it this way: If you feel worried about doing this, don't do it! It's unsupported and will void your warranty. The main reason I did this was because my phone felt old. If a new version of Android could breathe new life into it, great - if only for a few months. And if I would brick it, I would just be looking forward for a new Christmas gift for myself.</message>

In English:&#xD;
I rooted my phone, using SuperOneClick. Downloaded xRecovery installer from "Google Play", ran it, get the same look as on the guide you linked to. However when I click to install, only thing that happens is that the three little icons turn into crossed red rings. Do I have to do something before this step?&#xD;

&#xD;
This is a great guide, thanks for this. I am from Denmark, but will write in English for the sake of the wide world. Pelle says that when installing xRecovery he gets just red rings. As far as I understand from the comments on xRecovery, this is because read/write permission is needed on the rooted device, and not because of a lack of Busybox. I will continue to play with it:-)</message>

I did have Busybox. What I did was instead to download a Root Manager Lite and put the files directly into /system/bin instead of using the failing installer. It worked fine! Simon you can try it!&#xD;
&#xD;
Now I am on MiniCM7Pro V21 of CM for 2.3.7. It's like a fresh phone! Why did you opt to use another mod, Erik?&#xD;

My Swedish (physical) keyboard is mismatching BTW. Did you solve that?&#xD;

      <message>Hi Deepan,&#xD;
&#xD;
that doesn't sound good at all! The update process should only take a few minutes. If all else fails, you could try to restore the original firmware. Here is a very short video on how to do that:&#xD;
&#xD;
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zS2LIuy6YfY&#xD;
&#xD;
I can confirm that this works; I just did it five minutes ago. The basic steps are:&#xD;
&#xD;
1. Install and launch PC Companion&#xD;
2. Select to update the phone software&#xD;
3. Click to start, and when it complains it cannot find the phone, select "repair phone"&#xD;
4. Confirm that all data will be deleted and that you're OK with that&#xD;
5. (Not in the video) I was asked to switch off the phone, and connect it to the PC while holding the back button.&#xD;
&#xD;
After a few minutes, the update is complete. Start the phone and you're back with stock 2.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
Hope this helps.</message>

      <message>Hi Stoneman,&#xD;
&#xD;
this article is about upgrading to 2.3 Gingerbread, not 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich. ICS is not likely to work on this device. Try flashing with the original firmware to set things right again:&#xD;
&#xD;
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zS2LIuy6YfY&#xD;
&#xD;
However, if you are using another device than the X10 Mini Pro and the ICS firmware is official, contact Sony support instead. &#xD;
&#xD;
Good luck!</message>

      <message>Hi again Stoneman,&#xD;
&#xD;
if the phone is frozen and cannot be switched off using the power button, just take out the battery. After putting it back in, wait a while to make sure the phone doesn't turn itself back on automatically. You might have to give it a minute after taking the battery out or try a few times. After making sure the phone is off, you can hold the back button and connect it to the PC while PC Companion is waiting.</message>

      <message>Hi Joao,&#xD;
&#xD;
it could be a problem with SMS splitting:&#xD;

OR a problem with message center number:&#xD;

It might also be a problem with your carrier. Try sending/receiving from someone with a different carrier.&#xD;

If you cannot find a solution... install WhatsApp! ;)</message>

      <message>Hi Mr.Bheem,&#xD;
&#xD;
there could be several reasons. After a quick Google, here are some things people have tried, some of which may work:&#xD;
&#xD;
 - Turning off and turning on the phone&#xD;
 - Install and run the JuiceDefender app&#xD;
 - Factory reset the phone&#xD;
 - Let the phone drain the battery until it switches off itself, then recharge the phone to 100%, then switch it on&#xD;
&#xD;
See if any of these work for you. Otherwise, Google is your friend.</message>

      <message>Hi Joao,&#xD;
&#xD;
that sounds low. The capacity of the battery in this phone is, however, rather weak. In stand by with GSM only, I get maybe 48 hours. If I actually use the phone - calling, surfing, listening to music - then it might last just about a day. So it depends mainly on what you use it for and what apps you have running.</message>

      <message>Hi saad,&#xD;
&#xD;
from their website: "MiniCM is a custom-built ROM for the X10 Mini / X10 Mini Pro / X8 based on CyanogenMod."&#xD;
&#xD;
So with this ROM, you should be able to run Gingerbread, ICS or JB on the X10 Mini Pro. To find out more, go to their website:&#xD;
&#xD;
http://minicm.dyndns.org/site/&#xD;
&#xD;
Check out the information under the menu: Information =&gt; MiniCM[version] =&gt; mimmi</message>

      <message>Hi again Avro,

I don't know if this issue applies to the X10 mini pro, but seems to be relatively common with the "regular" X10. Basically, you can try:
 - Formatting the SD card using a PC or another phone
 - Trying/buying another SD card
Check this thread over at SonyMobile (reply #21):

http://talk.sonymobile.com/thread/21406?start=20&amp;tstart=0

If this is an official update from SonyEricsson (not CyanogenMod), you might get support from them directly. Hope things work out!</message>

@Dave: The applications are hosted by other providers so I cannot control whether they contain malware. I should point out though, that some antivirus programs report hacking tools as viruses, even though they are harmless (provided the users know what they are doing). On the SuperOneClick download page, there is a comment thread - check out the comments and consider asking if anyone else has the problem.</message>

@Md jobayer: Thank your for your post. However, it is difficult to tell what the problem might be. Maybe try upgrading to 2.3 using the instructions on this page? Could be worth a shot.</message>

      <message>Hi Vincent,

had this problem as well with some custom rom (can't remember which), but I did not really try to solve it, instead just installed another rom and that worked.

A guess: Maybe the layout of the keyboard changed in the software so that it does not correspond to the physical keyboard? This could be a problem eg. if you have a German phone and the layout changes to English - the Y and Z keys will then be swapped.</message>

I was partitioned my memory card into two (FAT32 and ex2) to support Link2SD app. The partitions are 3GB,1GB respectively. the question is .. in which partition I have to installed the update file? after updating the os, the ex2 partition part is visible in device ?give me the step by step guide...</message>

      <message>Hi Gseli, hi kiran tanka,

thank you for the feedback! About compatibility with the non-pro, I would recommend you use a rom specifically for that version. You can look at the cyanogenmod for xperia mini:

http://forum.cyanogenmod.com/topic/32772-cyanogenmod-7-for-the-xperia-mini-v7102-24-oct-2011/

There is also a whole forum section dedicated to the device at XDA Developers, where you can find more info and custom roms:

http://forum.xda-developers.com/forumdisplay.php?f=726

It could also be a good place to sort out the question regarding where to install it when the SD card is partitioned, because I'm afraid I don't know the answer myself.</message>

I'll consider making a video - but don't get your hopes up! I picked up the Nexus 4 recently and I now find it difficult to go back to the X10 Mini Pro. ;)

About benefits of rooting: Some applications require rooting to work - like file explorers that let you access more of the file system, powerful backup tools, or hardware tweaking tools. Titanium backup os one example, Root explorer another.</message>

      <message>I've been searching like a mad women for a lens I can use to take Birth pictures for a friend. Not knowing the lighting situation i need a lens that is good in low light and that i can capture great fast pictures without having to walk out of the room or be on top of the mother... What do you think of the 40mm in this situation? 
Thank you!</message>

      <message>Hi Maritza,

first of all: There is no such thing as a perfect lens - stop looking! ;)

That said, if you are on a crop sensor, the 40mm is a quite good choice. It should get you close enough for detail shots without you having to move too close, and it is still wide enough to capture both mother and child. Also, you will probably want to stay out of the way as much as possible, and you will not find a less intrusive lens than the pancake.

The not-so-fast 2.8 aperture may seem like a weak spot, but newborns tend to move very little so it should hopefully not be a problem.

By the way, check with the hospital in advance to make sure photography is not a problem. Also, some doctors are fine with flash use, which could come in handy.

Good luck!</message>

      <message>Hey Erik!
I'm getting into newborn photography, specially at home (as i don't have a studio) and actually I've seen a tutorial that advice the use of a 50mm prime lens. But after reading this post I'm confused! Maybe it's just this specific 50mm that it's not very good as it's really cheap compared to other 50mm I've seen.
Do you think to get started I can use this 50mm or it's just a bad investment?
Is there any other lens that you advice for this kind of photography? 
Thank you so much,

      <message>Hi Rita,

I would say it has a lot to do with personal preference, and what camera you have. I have seen people recommending everything from 28 mm to 85 mm for this purpose.

Personally, I find the 50 mm a bit too tight for many situations, especially indoors - but that is on a crop sensor camera, which makes it an 80 mm. This can be a good thing though if you prefer to stand further away from your subject. Try shooting at the long end of the kit lens to see if that focal length suits you, just to get a feel for it.

On a full frame however, the 50 mm focal length is quite versatile. Considering its price, the image quality is excellent. If you want to go professional, you might want to invest in something higher-grade though.

Hope this helps somewhat!</message>

      <message>Still don't know what to choose! :) Too many options, too little knowledge!! If I ask you which one would you recommend to start with? Of course I would love to go professional, but that's still far in the future i guess! And my camera it's a canon 600d... if that helps. And I've got the kit lens, and a tamron 18-200mm f/3.5-6.3 (if) macro. 
Thank you so much for your help!

      <message>I have the 600D myself, and while both lenses have good optics, I find the focal length of the 40 mm much more usable. This, combined with the compact format, makes it a great walkaround lens.

Still, the 50 mm is cheaper, and also faster. And the focal length is great for portraits, with its large aperture allowing for nicely blurred backgrounds.

The choice is yours. ;)</message>

      <message>Hi Joel,

well, that's basically three questions, so let's split it up:

1. Night photography: With an f/2.8 aperture and no optical image stabilizer, it's a bit slow for handheld night shots. Better bring a tripod.

2. Cars: If you mean car shows with a lot of people and little space, the 40 mm might prove a bit too tight. Some rough numbers: With the 40 mm, to shoot a 4 meter (13 ft) long object (small car), you will have to move back around 6 meters (20 ft). The kit lens at 18 mm needs only half the distance. The 40 mm makes a great lens for detail shots though.

3. Getting everything in focus: Sure, the 40 mm can do it. But a shorter lens can do it better. Anyway, you can experiment with the DOF calculator to see if 40 mm is the focal length for you:

      <message>hi, kindly allow me to ask few questions :)
I own 600D as well and one of my lens is the 50mm f/1.8.
However, lately I rarely use 50mm because it can't focus quick and to myself, the result is not so crisp especially at f/1.8.

what is your opinion about 40mm for my issues above? can it replace my 50mm with way more accurate focus and sharp result?

thanks in advance

      <message>Hi Huang,

I never had any focusing issues with the 50 mm. The 40 mm does feel slightly faster though, and definitely more quiet. Not enough to warrant buying a new lens only for this reason in my opinion (unless you do sports photography or something). If sharpness is the bigger problem, simply try stopping down to 2.8. It should be sharp enough, and still as fast as the 40 mm. Give it a shot.

The Tamron is a nice lens and definitely more versatile focal length-wise than the 40 mm prime. Unless you feel the biggest problems are size and weight, just keep using it.

The interesting thing about primes is mostly that they force you to think differently  about how to get the shot - you cannot just lazily stand around and zoom. But whether this is good or not is up to you. ;)</message>

      <message>Hi Chris,

on a crop body, the focal lengths of both lenses are good - many say around 80mm (35mm equivalent) lenses make the subject look their best.

The 50mm, with its slightly longer focal length and larger aperture, would be able to make the subject stand out more, since the background will be more blurred. Great for outdoor shots.

Obviously, portrait photography is more than just having a suitable lens. Maybe I'll exeriment a bit and write an article or two about it someday.</message>

I just stumbled across this in doing some research. I'm purchasing a canon 60d and have been looking at 3 lenses. I shoot mostly street, low light still, urban landscapes. I'm looking at the 50mm 1.8, the 40mm 2.8 pancake, and a tamron 17-50 which do you feel would work best?</message>

      <message>Hi Chris,

for any kind of landscape photography, be it urban or not, you will benefit from the larger field of view of the Tamron. The 40mm and 50mm are great for street (ie people) photography though - partly because they force you to think different about your shot, requiring you to move around to compose, and because they are small and light to carry anywhere.

But if I had to choose only one lens of those you mention, it would probably be the Tamron. The image quality should be good, and such a zoom lens comes in handy very often.</message>

since f/1.8 is one and a half stop faster than f/2.8, the 50mm will enable you to cut your exposure times by more than half if shooting open compared to the 40mm.</message>

      <message>Hello Erik!

I thought this review was superb!

One quick question: I will be leaving to Rome/Venice/Florence next week, and I was planning to buy a new lens for the trip. I will be shooting monuments, landscapes, and art. I will also shoot a couple videos here and there of the family...which lens (of the two above) do you think would be best for my personal uses. I'm leaning toward the pancake but have heard different opinions. Thanks!</message>

      <message>Hi Peter,

thank you for the kind words!

As you probably already have understood, I tend to lean towards the 40mm. It's small and sharp and difficult not to like.

However, you might feel a bit limited by the fixed focal length. 40mm (and 50mm) is great for detail shots and should also work well for art, but a shorter focal length would probably be more useful when shooting landscapes. Also, for videos, the 40mm is good but it lacks an image stabilizer which helps a lot to reduce shake.

Consider getting the 40mm and then, keeping things on a budget, simply bring the kit lens along. It's light, has a useful focal range and optical image stabilization. Aperture and image quality may not be great, but that's what the 40mm is for.

Hope this helps.</message>

      <message>Hi Peter,

what kind of camera do you have? Because lens number 4 (the 22mm) is using the EF-M mount and is not compatible with "standard" Canon SLRs.

I think you could benefit from something that is a bit wider than the 40mm, and the only lens that does that from those you listed is the kit lens (number 5 in the list). On a budget, the kit lens is a safe choice in many situations, but it may not have the best optical quality. 

The rest are rather long zoom lens, which seems less useful for what you intend to use it for.

Above, Chris asked whether a Tamron 17-50 is a good option... and I think it is! Consider adding it to the list. ;)</message>

 Just picked up my new pancake lens! So far, I think it's a great addition to my camera. I do have one quick question, and it's probably a stupid question but please bear with me since I am just starting DSLR's and am quite old and not too good with technology, 85 and still going strong! The 40mm lens does not zoom at all, is that how it is supposed to be? Or am I doing anything wrong? Thanks so much for your help!

      <message>No, you are not doing anything wrong. :) The 40mm is a prime lens, not a zoom lens - it has a fixed focal length. Zoom lenses may provide more flexibility, but prime lenses are usually lighter and have better optical quality.

Shooting with a prime lens may be difficult sometimes, but it also forces you to think differently about the shot - it takes more than just standing and zooming.

Keep shooting with it, it is certainly very rewarding.</message>

Firstly, thanks for this wondeful article. :)

Which one you would choose for video shooting? (for Canon EOS-M)

1- EF-M 22mm f/2
2- EF 50mm f/1.8 II (with EF Adapter)</message>

      <message>Thanks Ahmed! :)

For video, the 22mm should be more quiet while focusing, unless you stick to manual focus. Also, 22mm is a quite convenient focal length and you will not have to back off as much as with the tighter 50mm, especially if shooting indoor. I also feel that using the EOS-M with an adapter in part defeats its purpose.

The 50mm has a very shallow DOF so it will allow you to isolate subjects very effectively, more so than with the 22mm. Looks cool if that's your style. Otherwise, I would go for the 22mm with the EOS-M.</message>

I have a canon t3 (1100d) and i still have doubts between getting the 50mm or 40mm lens. I want to be able to get night shots, but I don't know if it's worth to get the 50mm because of the quality of the mount and the sharpness of the 40mm. But as I said, f/1.8 is quite better for night shots. Can i get an advice for that? :)</message>

      <message>@Bruna:

Guess that depends on the type of shot. For cityscapes, both lenses are too long and you are probably better off with the kit lens and a tripod. For other types of shot, you will probably want as much light as possible. I have found even the 1.8 to be barely enough for shooting people in a poorly lit restaurant, so I would say try the 50 mm.

@Marielle:

Thank you, and have fun with the lens! By the way, if you just like comparing photos in general, you might be interested in this comparison between DSLR, cell phone and compact:

      <message>Hello Erik,

Really a nice article comparing both the lenses. I've been using 18-55mm kit lens on my new 600D since last 2-3 months however I've noticed that most of the photos (60%) are not sharp as I'd have liked. Like others on this thread, I am also confused about 40mm /or/ 50mm. I mostly do portraits and close-ups so based on the discussion I feel I should go with 40mm. Can you shed some light on how sharp (in %) is 50mm as compared to 18-55mm kit lens? Also how sharp (in %) is 40mm as compared to 50mm? So this way we'll have a better idea of sharpness for all 3 lenses. Thank you.

      <message>Hi Erik , 
Loved the way you keep things simple and explain stuffs which most other websites fail to do .I have a similar question like Vivek has--
Which lens should i go with my canon 60d- canon 50mm 1.8 or canon 40mm f.2.8 ? I need lens for the below reasons

1)Street photography

      <message>Hello,
I'm really confused...
I own a canon eos 650D and i don't know which one to choose..

The 40mm f/2.8 stm or the 50mm f/1.8 II?

I want to use it for portrait/landscape/street.

Which one should i get?

      <message>Hi Robin, hi James,

seems like you are both asking the same question! The 650D and 60D are similar in many ways, so this should apply to both:

Portrait: Either will do, but the 50mm has a slight edge thanks to a shallower depth of field which isolates the subject. Also, the resulting focal length on a crop sensor camera is around 80mm, ideal for portraits.

Street: The compactness and wider field of view makes the 40mm the better choice in my book. Some may still find it a bit too long though.

Landscape: You're better off with the kit lens! Both lenses are too short for this purpose. Still, you can use either of them and software stitch the shots later. There might be better programs out there, but I sometimes Microsoft ICE which works for me:

Hope this helps somehow. ;)</message>

      <message>So if i read the comments...
If i would walk around in the city and just want to shoot pictures of people and other interresting stuff and i would like to do a little portret of people and animals inside and outside.

I can better get the 40mm above the 50mm  right?

Or am i wrong?

      <message>Hi ruud, hi Dave,

sure! As I see it, the 40mm should get the job done better. The 50mm feels too tight for such situations (unless you are on full frame). If you plan on shooting animals in low light, the 2.8 aperture might be too slow though - especially since animals tend to move when you don't want them to. A standard zoom lens (for flexibility) and an external flash gun (for quick shutter speeds) might serve you better in this case.

And also, there is no "right" or "wrong" here - it all depends on what you are comfortable shooting with. I know myself that I had the 50mm for quite some time without using it much, but the 40mm has basically stayed on since I got it - but that's just me. ;)</message>

      <message>Hi lloyd,

tough one! I have not tried the 1.4 myself, but from what I have heard, the price difference to the cheaper 50mm 1.8 is hard to justify for many. If the price is right and bokeh is your thing, it might be worth going for though. It should be great for portraits.

If possible, ask your friend if you can borrow and try out the lens for a day or two - that should make the decision easier.</message>

I just posted a quick comparison between the 40mm, 50mm, kit lens, and the Tamron 18-270. It could provide some more guidance:

while both lenses have good optical quality, they might be a bit too tight. Detail shots would work well though. Please read my previous comment on this:

      <message>Hi Erik,

I'm looking to get another lens other than my kit lens for the Rebel T2i that I own.  I'm mainly wanting to use it to shoot newborn and child photography.  I thought about just picking up the Prime 50mm lens since it's so inexpensive, but after reading your review I'm thinking the 40mm pancake lens is the way to go. In your opinion, which one do you think is better for newborn photography (mainly indoor) the 50 or the 40? And is there another "all purpose" lens that you can recommend I add that would also be good to have other than the kit lens and the prime lens? (I was thinking the Canon EF 24-105mm f/4, but feel it may be to heavy duty for what I need it for)

Thanks so much!

      <message>hi erik.. 

i want to do  portrait/street photography. i want better bokeh and sharpness. i have canon 600D.  cost is not my concern, i just want better quality of picture.
which will be better for me?

50mm f1.8 ? or
40mm f2.8?</message>

      <message>@Sally: The 50mm is a must for any canon user according to some, so do feel free to pick it up! The shallow depth of field and the slight fuzziness fully open can really create some magic. Personally, I still prefer the 40mm though, mostly because of its more usable focal length and build quality.

For an all-purpose lens, consider the Canon 15-85. Its weight and zoom range should be more fit for an APS sensor camera than the 24-105, and it's cheaper (although still a bit pricey). You might want to google some reviews to see if it's for you.

@razu: I prefer the 40mm, it's very sharp and has rounder bokeh. It's also smaller and focuses more quietly.</message>

      <message>Hi Erik

I have been using 50mm for a few months, until I dropped it and it parted into 2. I'm really into travel photography and 50mm hardly was of ne use as its angle was too narrow and if I focus an object close by the background is barely visible at 1.8 fstop. Though the 'object' comes out to b real awesum. Sharpness is an issue in long distance shots. And I find it too bright in daylight even at iso 100. For travel Its of no good. But for portraits its unmatched. 
How's 40mm for travel, long shots, and how wide is it?</message>

i just really want your opinion about this.
Is 40mm is really a good upgrade from Canon 18-55isII?
or should i just stay in my kit lens?

      <message>@kenneth: The 40mm is sharper and faster, but it lacks optical image stabilizer and also zoom. In that sense, it's not a pure upgrade since there are tradeoffs. If you think the 40mm will suit your needs, by means, go for it. But if you feel that zoom and IS are important, consider a quality zoom lens instead.

      <message>hello Erik,

about the fact that the system "kicks in" and freezes the image. I just bought this same lense, and when focussing, the image in the viewfinder actually moves a fraction to the left down corner, and when releasing it again (without taking the shot) it moves back again. Do you notice the same effect happening?

thanks,
Jan</message>

      <message>Hi Jan,

not sure it's the same thing as you describe, but with the camera on a tripod and image stabilization turned on, after focusing - and that's when the IS kicks in - it starts drifting around quite a bit. It keeps on doing that until the IS is deactivated after a few seconds. The effect is very noticeable at the long end and using live view. The stabilizer tries to correct errors that don't exist and end up creating errors on its own. It's normal for this type of lens; IS only works for fairly quick shutter speeds anyway, and makes no sense on a tripod. But it still looks weird. ;)</message>

      <message>Thanks a lot for your comparsion Erik.

So as i see it the 50mm will not do good photos on f/1.8 if handheld,
so its better to go for the 40mm pancake.

and i read in your comparsion between the 40mm and 50mm that the 40mm pancake does not have stabilizer, how important is the stabilizer, for this lens?

Thanks</message>

I have the 650D with 18-135 STM lens and the aperture goes to f/3.5,
will i see i different with the 50mm and 40mm when i take picture in indoor low light situation.

      <message>Hi Hashim,

thank you for you comment. The reason why the 50mm is so blurry wide open is not because it's handheld in this case, but simply because it's not sharp at a fully open aperture (ie. not because of slow shutter speeds).

Regarding image stabilization, I blogged about that quite a while ago. I used the kit lens at 55mm and shot with and without IS at different shutter speeds. In conclusion, IS helps quite a bit (but of course, only if the scene is static). Read here:

http://www.erikmoberg.net/article/canon_image_stabilizer_is_test

For indoor low light shooting, if you stay at 18mm, you will not notice much difference to the 40mm. The 50mm is quite a bit faster and could suit better, if you can live with (or prefer) that fuzzy look it produces wide open. Still, it may not be able to freeze action (like kids moving around), so if that's your thing, hold on to that lens and get an external flash instead.

Happy shooting!</message>
