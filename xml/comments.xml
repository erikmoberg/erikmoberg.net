      <message>Nice review! I really is a pretty decent phone. &#xD;
I am a bit shocked by a max of 2 days battery life, though. My HTC Magic can make 3 days if I don't use it much.&#xD;
Totally agree on the crappy music player that comes with it - I recently installed Mort Player (free), which seems to be a lot better.</message>

      <message>About battery life: I learned it the hard way after the phone died on me - after just some 36 hours of usage. NES emulation seems to need a lot of juice. YMMV, as always.&#xD;
&#xD;
I also use and can warmly recommend the Mort Player. Look at the picture of the phone in this review - the upper right shortcut actually points to Mort and not the default player (you can tell by the icon).</message>

      <message>Emulation is a battery hog. Usually the emulator is written in a way that it doesn't sleep at all and is running the emulated CPU etc. all the time. &#xD;
I don't know what the official standby time is but the journalist tech geeks seems to charge their cellphones every evening.&#xD;
Only android 1.6... that ain't new... but it may be easier on the batteries with less features.</message>

      <message>Just to make things clear, an Android 2.1 update is available for this phone since several months back and it is working well. It does not slow down the phone (noticeably) and it fixes some problems - some web pages not working properly in the browser before now show up as expected, for example.</message>

      <message>Hey man, graet review. I just have 1 question. You say the Plantronic one is not chargable while using it. Is that becuase of the range of the USB cable or the fact that it has no power in it while its battery is dead? I mean if I were to buy a longer miniusb to usb cable and the headset died, could I plug that on in, w8 10 min and use it while being charge?&#xD;
&#xD;
Thanks fpr reading // Hab</message>

      <message>Sorry for taking so long time replying to this, but better late than never I guess. Fact is, the headset cannot be used when charging at all, it basically stays switched off while charging. The Creative headset does not suffer from this.</message>

      <message>Hi Don,&#xD;
&#xD;
there are a few things you can do to make sure things are set up properly. A common problem is that Windows is sending sound to the wrong device, since the OS can only direct sound output to one device at a time.&#xD;
&#xD;
After connecting the USB dongle and having turned on the headset, right click the speaker icon next to the Windows clock and select "Playback devices". The headset should show up in the list. Now, select the headset and click the "Set Default" button (or select "Default communication device" if you only want to use it with Skype and the like). Click "Properties" and make sure the volume is not set to zero (under the "Levels" tab).&#xD;
&#xD;
For mic setup, just select "Recording devices" instead of "Playback devices" and you will be able to figure out the rest.&#xD;
&#xD;
The changes should take effect immediately, but in some cases you may have to restart the application playing sounds (Windows Media Player, Skype or whatever).&#xD;
&#xD;
If this doesn't help, try using the headset with another PC.</message>

&#xD;
according to Plantronics, the dongle does not support multipoint. Thus, it is only possible to connect one headset, not two.</message>

to make sure that Skype is using the headset, go to Tools-&gt;audio settings and select the Plantronics as both microphone and speakers. Also see tip above in comments regarding setting the default audio devices in Windows.</message>

      <message>Thank you Eric for this nice comparison a few years ago. I was actually using the 995 for many years. I found it buy chance on a website and got stuck with it.
Every one of my headsets lasts for 1-1.5 years and dies (either the battery stops being able to be charged and it is irreplaceable or it just stops communicating with the dongle) and now I'm sick of it.
The last one I had died months ago and now I am looking for a better option and thinking to myself "they must've developed a new thing that is better after all these years".
Better, I mean, a Plantronics that:
1. works while charging
&amp;
2. has a replaceable battery
I am actually willing to pay much more because I am so used to those things.
Any suggestions?</message>

      <message>Hi Vin,

you may not like my answer, but I currently use a wired Steelseries Siberia V2 headset and I have no complaints. Cutting the cord still has its share of problems, mostly battery life. Some colleagues of mine use wireless headsets for Skype (Logitech H800) and because of the battery drain, they simply keep them plugged in most of the time, mostly defeating the purpose of using a wireless headset. But at least you can charge while using them. Maybe worth a shot?</message>

      <message>Nicely done! I have tried this to, but only with one long exposure. They are - as you probably know - not that good. Even at ISO100 is there a lot of grain and all those annoying hot pixels on the sensor are visible. And just as you&#xB4;ve written will parts of the image be overexposed by the surrounding city lights. I don&#xB4;t have a remote shutter (besides the IR) and will thus keep this project in mind for the future.</message>

      <message>Well, I'm not sure rooting it will really solve any of the inherent limitations of 2.1 - the lack of flash support is a major flaw, and I have yet to find a working solution.&#xD;

But rooting is fun, so why not? I recommend you head over to the nice people at android tablets, they have a lot of good tips:&#xD;

      <message>To use the keyboard, you need to activate USB Host mode. Go to Settings, select "USB Mode Select" and tick "Host Mode". The keyboard (or other USB devices, like USB sticks) can now be connected.&#xD;
&#xD;
After a reboot, the setting is reset and need to be reactivated. Apparently, it draws a lot of power so this should be a "good thing".</message>

      <message>Hi Julie,&#xD;
&#xD;
tough one. I had zero problems setting mine up. The router was set to use WPA2 with AES and a pre-shared key. My network showed up in the list (Wireless &amp; network settings), I chose it, left security to auto, entered password and it just worked.&#xD;
&#xD;
I would do the usual things; reboot the router, play around a bit with the security settings (on both ends), and, if nothing helps, try the tablet on a friend's network. Maybe the tablet just doesn't play nice with your router. Also, I have heard that there are compatibility issues between some 802.11n devices, 802.11b/g (slower/older router) should be fine though. &#xD;
&#xD;
Hope this helps.</message>

I'm afraid I will have to disappoint you. I don't have the firmware for 741, neither do I know which one it uses or how to acquire it. If it's under warranty, just exchange for a new one.&#xD;
&#xD;
If that is not an option, you can find a lot of information on how to install firmware/fixing bricked tablets here:&#xD;

&#xD;
to clear the history, open the browser and tap the menu button (top right of the screen, as always). From the menu, tap "more", then "Settings". Scroll down to "Privacy". From here, cache, history and cookies can be deleted.&#xD;
&#xD;
Google also saves your search history, which you can delete separately. From the Google start page, tap the "Settings" link. Scroll down to "Search history" and tap "Clear saved searches".&#xD;
&#xD;
Hope this helps.</message>

      <message>Hi Nigel,&#xD;
&#xD;
I am not familiar with the AK Notepad myself, but I guess it's possible that it just doesn't work on the SmartPad. This just tends to happen sometimes - it is a quite cheap product with almost zero support, after all. I'm afraid the only tip I can give you is to reinstall the app, and if that doesn't work, try to find an alternative (there should be plenty).</message>

      <message>Hi Kate,&#xD;
&#xD;
sure thing! (Assuming you mean Kindle.) Just use the ASK and open the Android Market, then search for "Amazon Kindle" or something similar. The official Kindle app should show up. Download and install, then start the application. Log on with your Amazon username and password, and you are good to go. They have a few free samples (classics like Dracula or Pride and Prejudice) that you can try first.&#xD;
&#xD;
The application runs just fine on the ASK, maybe a bit sluggish when flipping but perfectly acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
Have fun!</message>

I found the tablet turns itself back on very often. It uses more battery. I only installed Aldiko as my bookreader and  juice defender. I couldn't work out what cause the problem.&#xD;

weird problem. My tablet only turns itself on when I plug in the charger, which seems to be a "feature". If you feel bored, you might try a factory reset, it's always a blast. ;)</message>

I have not been able to resolve this issue. Skype on Android is still immature and crashes on many devices (it works great on my SonyEricsson X10 Mini Pro though). Just keep updating to the latest version, I hope they will have these issues sorted out soon.</message>

      <message>Hi mark,&#xD;
&#xD;
I'm not quite sure what you mean. If it does not boot up at all and you just got it, it may be a hardware of firmware problem. Try contacting the shop where you bought it to see if you can get a new one. By the way, a corrupt firmware can usually be fixed by downloading the latest one from the manufacturer and extracting it to the root of the SD card. I'm afraid I don't know where to get the firmware though. Try contacting ASK. Their home page address is:&#xD;

and thanks for your interest in this article. Now, you did link to a Honeycomb system image which I highly doubt will work right off the bat for the SmartPad. To avoid people bricking their devices, I removed the download link. Please let me know (using the contact form) if you have successfully updated the device to 3.0 using the image. If so, I apologize and will re-add the link.</message>

not sure there is one! It should work just like any "standard" Android 4.0 device though, so if you are having specific questions about the software, googling it should do it. Plenty of forums and blogs around with info on Android 4.0. Otherwise, just contact ASK directly: &#xD;

sorry for the late reply... and for not having an answer! I have a Gemei G9 tablet, and I have never gotten  the HDMI port on it to work. Apparently, just connecting it to the TV and switching TV to the correct HDMI port should do it. Maybe another TV and cable would solve it?</message>

      <message>@mona: Not sure about the 755SP, but many tablet can be charger using a special USB cable (usually provided), but also using the regular mini/micro-USB (sync) port. So if one does not work, try the other one. 

@Mehrad: Possibly, the countries use different standards. But I know very little about this, feel free to post back here if you manage to solve it.</message>

the factory reset is found under Settings -&gt; Privacy (5th item in the list, with a fence icon). Tap the last option ("Factory data reset") and tap the button that shows up ("reset device").

If the language on the whole device changes, go to Settings -&gt; Language &amp; keyboard (7th item, with a keyboard key icon). Tap the first item ("Select locale") and select a language.</message>

Something I wanted to add, I have a nikon d700 and I think all nikon's have on their sides triangular "keychains" placed to attach your strap. I managed to place my hook directly on it, eliminating the need for the tripod base.&#xD;

Seems like they don't have the Nissin SpeedLite Di622 Mark I anymore though. You will need to pay up a bit to get the Mark II, but the new features should be worth it.</message>

      <message>Hi Karina,&#xD;
&#xD;
it's quite simple actually - for folding instructions, just follow the link:&#xD;
&#xD;
http://www.coolopticalillusions.com/illusions/coolprinttriangle.pdf&#xD;
&#xD;
I found using a fairly a long lens (&gt;100mm) helps "flatten" the look of the triangle. Getting the right angle is critical. Put the triangle on the floor or on a table and walk around it to find the right spot. Mount the camera on a tripod there. The tripod helps, since you can make small adjustments to the angle and composition without having to start over every time. Hand-holding gets very tiresome. Keep shooting and adjusting until you get it right.</message>

      <message>Decent run down of the device.  Sorry to hear you have had some of those build quality type issues, but glad to hear it is workable for you.  In regards to your article here are some things that may you or your readers out.&#xD;
1) Head on over to SlateDroid.com Forums.&#xD;
 - You will find plenty of threads and support for the Gemei G9 in it's own section&#xD;
2) Download the ICS firmware posted there and install it&#xD;
3) Run the "SuperScript" and you can open up the market and compatibility along with rooting and tweaking.&#xD;
&#xD;
In regards to Skype, there is a fully working previous version 2.5.x.x posted in a separate thread that you can download and install to have working video both ways.&#xD;
&#xD;
The battery life on the device is already great, but can be made even better by downloading SetCPU and following the settings guide thread in the Benchmark section of SlateDroid.&#xD;
&#xD;
Keep up the good work!&#xD;

      <message>Awesome comparison between the Canon EOS 600D and 1000D! I just wanted to leave a quick comment to let you know about our awesome gadget for photographers of every level. :) The Hufa Holder lens cap clip was designed by photographers after they had, like many other photographers do, lost a TON of lens caps. The nifty little device just clips right on your strap and keeps your cap in place while you're shooting! Turns out, we lose a whole lot less lens caps this way! :) This also works no matter what camera you are using. Here is a video for you to check it out http://bit.ly/Nu7FPx. Thanks again for sharing your Canon EOS comparison! Hope you'll check out our gadget when you get a chance.&#xD;

      <message>Thanks for sharing this review. This has helped me a lot. I have a 1000d and was thinking of upgrading the body, but have decided to stay put with 1000d since I shoot only using optical viewfinder and the center focus point, and usually in daylight. At night I use the 50mm 1.8 so I don't need to use a higher ISO. I will spend the money on a wide angle lens instead and work on my composition skills.

I think the only thing that would have really helped me is Spot Metering, and a faster shutter speed - but I will try to make do with the Partial Metering for now.</message>

      <message>Those who are Comparing Canon 1000D with 600D take a shower bro !! 600D Considered as so many professional's choice, where 1000D is almost OUTDATED basic DSLR(Aug 2008). I have used both of em several times. You don't have to argue with me, there is so many Experts Review as well as Users review available on thousand of websites across the INTERNET not for COMPARE THOSE , I am talking about the Advantages of 600D over 100D . Blindly anyone can Upgrade from 1000D to 600D. Beside being a Nikon user I cannot stop myself to write these words after reading this stuff. Though its for those who have time can read below-

The Canon EOS 600D is a logical, if not strictly necessary, update of the 550D. It's not a camera that'll go down in history but it's a decent SLR that takes good pictures and has plenty of settings. With EF-S 55-250mm the toy works like a charm , Buttery smooth with Crisp Results more than Any Beginner's expectation.</message>

Thank you for the input. I agree that the 600D is definitely the better camera and I'm still quite happy with it myself. But I just noticed this article is two years old, and by now, both cameras feel rather dated! I might consider an upgrade soon. ;)</message>

      <message>Erik, Help me once more. Still I'm in love very much with my 1000D. Will with be with this for another couple  of Years. I'm using a Canon Zoom Lens EF-S 18-55 mm (1:3.5-5.6 II NON-IS) and a Canon Zoom Lens EFS 55-250 mm (1:4-5.6 IS II). Both the lenses are good. But they create a problem in emergency when  lens change is required. I plan to change them with a Tamron AF 18-200mm F/3.5-6.3 XR Di II LD Aspherical [IF] MACRO? Is my decision correct? I'm normally a General Clicker. Love to click everything.

      <message>Hi Tutu,

I have a similar lens myself, a Tamron 18-270. I wrote a little review here:

http://www.erikmoberg.net/article/new_lens_-_tamron_18-270_3.5-6.3_di_ii_vc

What it lacks in optical quality, it makes up in flexibility. So when I know what will be shooting, I usually pick another lens. But when I don't, i take this one and it makes sure I always get the shot.</message>

      <message>Dear Eric, Just let me know 
1) Whether the quality of Tamron AF 18-200mm F/3.5-6.3 XR Di II LD Aspherical [IF] MACRO is better than the Canon Zoom Lens EF-S 18-55 mm (1:3.5-5.6 II NON-IS) or not?
2) Is Tamron AF 18-200mm F/3.5-6.3 XR Di II LD Aspherical [IF] MACRO is better than Canon Zoom Lens EFS 55-250 mm (1:4-5.6 IS II)?   </message>

      <message>Hi Tutu,

to both questions, at least from what I can gather from the reviews, the answer would be "about the same". The image quality of the Tamron is good, but hardly spectacular, and comes in a convenient package. The price point is also good. However, the lack of an optical stabilizer might be a problem at longer focal lengths, unless you are using a tripod. Your 55-250 has IS, try shooting with it switched off to find out.</message>

let me put it this way: If you feel worried about doing this, don't do it! It's unsupported and will void your warranty. The main reason I did this was because my phone felt old. If a new version of Android could breathe new life into it, great - if only for a few months. And if I would brick it, I would just be looking forward for a new Christmas gift for myself.</message>

This is a great guide, thanks for this. I am from Denmark, but will write in English for the sake of the wide world. Pelle says that when installing xRecovery he gets just red rings. As far as I understand from the comments on xRecovery, this is because read/write permission is needed on the rooted device, and not because of a lack of Busybox. I will continue to play with it:-)</message>

I cannot help you directly with that, but do take a look at these SonyEricsson X10 forum sections at CyanogenMod and XDA Developers:&#xD;
&#xD;
http://forum.cyanogenmod.org/forum/438-sony-ericsson-xperia-x10/&#xD;

They should provide all information you need. Have fun!</message>

      <message>Hi Deepan,&#xD;
&#xD;
that doesn't sound good at all! The update process should only take a few minutes. If all else fails, you could try to restore the original firmware. Here is a very short video on how to do that:&#xD;
&#xD;
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zS2LIuy6YfY&#xD;
&#xD;
I can confirm that this works; I just did it five minutes ago. The basic steps are:&#xD;
&#xD;
1. Install and launch PC Companion&#xD;
2. Select to update the phone software&#xD;
3. Click to start, and when it complains it cannot find the phone, select "repair phone"&#xD;
4. Confirm that all data will be deleted and that you're OK with that&#xD;
5. (Not in the video) I was asked to switch off the phone, and connect it to the PC while holding the back button.&#xD;
&#xD;
After a few minutes, the update is complete. Start the phone and you're back with stock 2.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
Hope this helps.</message>

      <message>Hi Stoneman,&#xD;
&#xD;
this article is about upgrading to 2.3 Gingerbread, not 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich. ICS is not likely to work on this device. Try flashing with the original firmware to set things right again:&#xD;
&#xD;
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zS2LIuy6YfY&#xD;
&#xD;
However, if you are using another device than the X10 Mini Pro and the ICS firmware is official, contact Sony support instead. &#xD;
&#xD;
Good luck!</message>

      <message>Hi again Stoneman,&#xD;
&#xD;
if the phone is frozen and cannot be switched off using the power button, just take out the battery. After putting it back in, wait a while to make sure the phone doesn't turn itself back on automatically. You might have to give it a minute after taking the battery out or try a few times. After making sure the phone is off, you can hold the back button and connect it to the PC while PC Companion is waiting.</message>

      <message>Hi Mr.Bheem,&#xD;
&#xD;
there could be several reasons. After a quick Google, here are some things people have tried, some of which may work:&#xD;
&#xD;
 - Turning off and turning on the phone&#xD;
 - Install and run the JuiceDefender app&#xD;
 - Factory reset the phone&#xD;
 - Let the phone drain the battery until it switches off itself, then recharge the phone to 100%, then switch it on&#xD;
&#xD;
See if any of these work for you. Otherwise, Google is your friend.</message>

      <message>Hi Joao,&#xD;
&#xD;
that sounds low. The capacity of the battery in this phone is, however, rather weak. In stand by with GSM only, I get maybe 48 hours. If I actually use the phone - calling, surfing, listening to music - then it might last just about a day. So it depends mainly on what you use it for and what apps you have running.</message>

&#xD;
from their website: "MiniCM is a custom-built ROM for the X10 Mini / X10 Mini Pro / X8 based on CyanogenMod."&#xD;
&#xD;
So with this ROM, you should be able to run Gingerbread, ICS or JB on the X10 Mini Pro. To find out more, go to their website:&#xD;
&#xD;
http://minicm.dyndns.org/site/&#xD;
&#xD;
Check out the information under the menu: Information =&gt; MiniCM[version] =&gt; mimmi</message>

      <message>Hi again Avro,

I don't know if this issue applies to the X10 mini pro, but seems to be relatively common with the "regular" X10. Basically, you can try:
 - Formatting the SD card using a PC or another phone
 - Trying/buying another SD card
Check this thread over at SonyMobile (reply #21):

http://talk.sonymobile.com/thread/21406?start=20&amp;tstart=0

If this is an official update from SonyEricsson (not CyanogenMod), you might get support from them directly. Hope things work out!</message>

@Dave: The applications are hosted by other providers so I cannot control whether they contain malware. I should point out though, that some antivirus programs report hacking tools as viruses, even though they are harmless (provided the users know what they are doing). On the SuperOneClick download page, there is a comment thread - check out the comments and consider asking if anyone else has the problem.</message>

      <message>Hi Vincent,

had this problem as well with some custom rom (can't remember which), but I did not really try to solve it, instead just installed another rom and that worked.

A guess: Maybe the layout of the keyboard changed in the software so that it does not correspond to the physical keyboard? This could be a problem eg. if you have a German phone and the layout changes to English - the Y and Z keys will then be swapped.</message>

I was partitioned my memory card into two (FAT32 and ex2) to support Link2SD app. The partitions are 3GB,1GB respectively. the question is .. in which partition I have to installed the update file? after updating the os, the ex2 partition part is visible in device ?give me the step by step guide...</message>

      <message>Hi Gseli, hi kiran tanka,

thank you for the feedback! About compatibility with the non-pro, I would recommend you use a rom specifically for that version. You can look at the cyanogenmod for xperia mini:

http://forum.cyanogenmod.com/topic/32772-cyanogenmod-7-for-the-xperia-mini-v7102-24-oct-2011/

There is also a whole forum section dedicated to the device at XDA Developers, where you can find more info and custom roms:

http://forum.xda-developers.com/forumdisplay.php?f=726

It could also be a good place to sort out the question regarding where to install it when the SD card is partitioned, because I'm afraid I don't know the answer myself.</message>

I'll consider making a video - but don't get your hopes up! I picked up the Nexus 4 recently and I now find it difficult to go back to the X10 Mini Pro. ;)

About benefits of rooting: Some applications require rooting to work - like file explorers that let you access more of the file system, powerful backup tools, or hardware tweaking tools. Titanium backup os one example, Root explorer another.</message>

      <message>Hi Maritza,

first of all: There is no such thing as a perfect lens - stop looking! ;)

That said, if you are on a crop sensor, the 40mm is a quite good choice. It should get you close enough for detail shots without you having to move too close, and it is still wide enough to capture both mother and child. Also, you will probably want to stay out of the way as much as possible, and you will not find a less intrusive lens than the pancake.

The not-so-fast 2.8 aperture may seem like a weak spot, but newborns tend to move very little so it should hopefully not be a problem.

By the way, check with the hospital in advance to make sure photography is not a problem. Also, some doctors are fine with flash use, which could come in handy.

Good luck!</message>

      <message>Hey Erik!
I'm getting into newborn photography, specially at home (as i don't have a studio) and actually I've seen a tutorial that advice the use of a 50mm prime lens. But after reading this post I'm confused! Maybe it's just this specific 50mm that it's not very good as it's really cheap compared to other 50mm I've seen.
Do you think to get started I can use this 50mm or it's just a bad investment?
Is there any other lens that you advice for this kind of photography? 
Thank you so much,

      <message>Hi Rita,

I would say it has a lot to do with personal preference, and what camera you have. I have seen people recommending everything from 28 mm to 85 mm for this purpose.

Personally, I find the 50 mm a bit too tight for many situations, especially indoors - but that is on a crop sensor camera, which makes it an 80 mm. This can be a good thing though if you prefer to stand further away from your subject. Try shooting at the long end of the kit lens to see if that focal length suits you, just to get a feel for it.

On a full frame however, the 50 mm focal length is quite versatile. Considering its price, the image quality is excellent. If you want to go professional, you might want to invest in something higher-grade though.

Hope this helps somewhat!</message>

Of course I would love to go professional, but that's still far in the future i guess! And my camera it's a canon 600d... if that helps. And I've got the kit lens, and a tamron 18-200mm f/3.5-6.3 (if) macro. 
Thank you so much for your help!

      <message>I have the 600D myself, and while both lenses have good optics, I find the focal length of the 40 mm much more usable. This, combined with the compact format, makes it a great walkaround lens.

Still, the 50 mm is cheaper, and also faster. And the focal length is great for portraits, with its large aperture allowing for nicely blurred backgrounds.

The choice is yours. ;)</message>

      <message>Hi Joel,

well, that's basically three questions, so let's split it up:

1. Night photography: With an f/2.8 aperture and no optical image stabilizer, it's a bit slow for handheld night shots. Better bring a tripod.

2. Cars: If you mean car shows with a lot of people and little space, the 40 mm might prove a bit too tight. Some rough numbers: With the 40 mm, to shoot a 4 meter (13 ft) long object (small car), you will have to move back around 6 meters (20 ft). The kit lens at 18 mm needs only half the distance. The 40 mm makes a great lens for detail shots though.

3. Getting everything in focus: Sure, the 40 mm can do it. But a shorter lens can do it better. Anyway, you can experiment with the DOF calculator to see if 40 mm is the focal length for you:

Hope this helps!</message>

      <message>hi, kindly allow me to ask few questions :)
I own 600D as well and one of my lens is the 50mm f/1.8.
However, lately I rarely use 50mm because it can't focus quick and to myself, the result is not so crisp especially at f/1.8.

what is your opinion about 40mm for my issues above? can it replace my 50mm with way more accurate focus and sharp result?

thanks in advance

      <message>sorry, I forgot to ask 1 more question.

I also have tamron 28-75 f/2.8, which also cover the focal length of canon 40mm. if you were me, do you think it's worth it to have them both?

once again, thanks.</message>

      <message>Hi Huang,

I never had any focusing issues with the 50 mm. The 40 mm does feel slightly faster though, and definitely more quiet. Not enough to warrant buying a new lens only for this reason in my opinion (unless you do sports photography or something). If sharpness is the bigger problem, simply try stopping down to 2.8. It should be sharp enough, and still as fast as the 40 mm. Give it a shot.

The Tamron is a nice lens and definitely more versatile focal length-wise than the 40 mm prime. Unless you feel the biggest problems are size and weight, just keep using it.

The interesting thing about primes is mostly that they force you to think differently  about how to get the shot - you cannot just lazily stand around and zoom. But whether this is good or not is up to you. ;)</message>

      <message>Hi Chris,

on a crop body, the focal lengths of both lenses are good - many say around 80mm (35mm equivalent) lenses make the subject look their best.

The 50mm, with its slightly longer focal length and larger aperture, would be able to make the subject stand out more, since the background will be more blurred. Great for outdoor shots.

Obviously, portrait photography is more than just having a suitable lens. Maybe I'll exeriment a bit and write an article or two about it someday.</message>

I just stumbled across this in doing some research. I'm purchasing a canon 60d and have been looking at 3 lenses. I shoot mostly street, low light still, urban landscapes. I'm looking at the 50mm 1.8, the 40mm 2.8 pancake, and a tamron 17-50 which do you feel would work best?</message>

      <message>Hi Chris,

for any kind of landscape photography, be it urban or not, you will benefit from the larger field of view of the Tamron. The 40mm and 50mm are great for street (ie people) photography though - partly because they force you to think different about your shot, requiring you to move around to compose, and because they are small and light to carry anywhere.

But if I had to choose only one lens of those you mention, it would probably be the Tamron. The image quality should be good, and such a zoom lens comes in handy very often.</message>

      <message>Hi Erik,

Can you tell me whether the 50mm f/1.8 is significantly faster than the 40mm pancake?

I basically want one of the two for my low light photography as my second lens.

Thanks.</message>

      <message>Hi Apurva,

since f/1.8 is one and a half stop faster than f/2.8, the 50mm will enable you to cut your exposure times by more than half if shooting open compared to the 40mm.</message>

      <message>Hello Erik!

I thought this review was superb!

One quick question: I will be leaving to Rome/Venice/Florence next week, and I was planning to buy a new lens for the trip. I will be shooting monuments, landscapes, and art. I will also shoot a couple videos here and there of the family...which lens (of the two above) do you think would be best for my personal uses. I'm leaning toward the pancake but have heard different opinions. Thanks!</message>

      <message>Hi Peter,

thank you for the kind words!

As you probably already have understood, I tend to lean towards the 40mm. It's small and sharp and difficult not to like.

However, you might feel a bit limited by the fixed focal length. 40mm (and 50mm) is great for detail shots and should also work well for art, but a shorter focal length would probably be more useful when shooting landscapes. Also, for videos, the 40mm is good but it lacks an image stabilizer which helps a lot to reduce shake.

Consider getting the 40mm and then, keeping things on a budget, simply bring the kit lens along. It's light, has a useful focal range and optical image stabilization. Aperture and image quality may not be great, but that's what the 40mm is for.

Hope this helps.</message>

      <message>Hi Peter,

what kind of camera do you have? Because lens number 4 (the 22mm) is using the EF-M mount and is not compatible with "standard" Canon SLRs.

I think you could benefit from something that is a bit wider than the 40mm, and the only lens that does that from those you listed is the kit lens (number 5 in the list). On a budget, the kit lens is a safe choice in many situations, but it may not have the best optical quality. 

The rest are rather long zoom lens, which seems less useful for what you intend to use it for.

Above, Chris asked whether a Tamron 17-50 is a good option... and I think it is! Consider adding it to the list. ;)</message>

      <message>Hey Erik,

 Just picked up my new pancake lens! So far, I think it's a great addition to my camera. I do have one quick question, and it's probably a stupid question but please bear with me since I am just starting DSLR's and am quite old and not too good with technology, 85 and still going strong! The 40mm lens does not zoom at all, is that how it is supposed to be? Or am I doing anything wrong? Thanks so much for your help!

      <message>No, you are not doing anything wrong. :) The 40mm is a prime lens, not a zoom lens - it has a fixed focal length. Zoom lenses may provide more flexibility, but prime lenses are usually lighter and have better optical quality.

Shooting with a prime lens may be difficult sometimes, but it also forces you to think differently about the shot - it takes more than just standing and zooming.

Keep shooting with it, it is certainly very rewarding.</message>

Firstly, thanks for this wondeful article. :)

Secondly,
Which one you would choose for video shooting? (for Canon EOS-M)

1- EF-M 22mm f/2
2- EF 50mm f/1.8 II (with EF Adapter)</message>

      <message>Thanks Ahmed! :)

For video, the 22mm should be more quiet while focusing, unless you stick to manual focus. Also, 22mm is a quite convenient focal length and you will not have to back off as much as with the tighter 50mm, especially if shooting indoor. I also feel that using the EOS-M with an adapter in part defeats its purpose.

The 50mm has a very shallow DOF so it will allow you to isolate subjects very effectively, more so than with the 22mm. Looks cool if that's your style. Otherwise, I would go for the 22mm with the EOS-M.</message>

      <message>Thanks for your comparison. Plastic fantastic is so weak and ugly that i cannot let me buy such a piece of shit. EF 50mm 1.4 is much better but overpriced twice. So I decided to get one nice 40mm. Good built quality and sharp lens. And one more thing that 40mm have 7 blades diaphragm versus 6 blades on 50mm. It means more round bokeh</message>

I have a canon t3 (1100d) and i still have doubts between getting the 50mm or 40mm lens. I want to be able to get night shots, but I don't know if it's worth to get the 50mm because of the quality of the mount and the sharpness of the 40mm. But as I said, f/1.8 is quite better for night shots. Can i get an advice for that? :)</message>

      <message>@Bruna:

Guess that depends on the type of shot. For cityscapes, both lenses are too long and you are probably better off with the kit lens and a tripod. For other types of shot, you will probably want as much light as possible. I have found even the 1.8 to be barely enough for shooting people in a poorly lit restaurant, so I would say try the 50 mm.

@Marielle:

Thank you, and have fun with the lens! By the way, if you just like comparing photos in general, you might be interested in this comparison between DSLR, cell phone and compact:

      <message>Hello Erik,

Really a nice article comparing both the lenses. I've been using 18-55mm kit lens on my new 600D since last 2-3 months however I've noticed that most of the photos (60%) are not sharp as I'd have liked. Like others on this thread, I am also confused about 40mm /or/ 50mm. I mostly do portraits and close-ups so based on the discussion I feel I should go with 40mm. Can you shed some light on how sharp (in %) is 50mm as compared to 18-55mm kit lens? Also how sharp (in %) is 40mm as compared to 50mm? So this way we'll have a better idea of sharpness for all 3 lenses. Thank you.

      <message>Hi Robin, hi James,

seems like you are both asking the same question! The 650D and 60D are similar in many ways, so this should apply to both:

Portrait: Either will do, but the 50mm has a slight edge thanks to a shallower depth of field which isolates the subject. Also, the resulting focal length on a crop sensor camera is around 80mm, ideal for portraits.

Street: The compactness and wider field of view makes the 40mm the better choice in my book. Some may still find it a bit too long though.

Landscape: You're better off with the kit lens! Both lenses are too short for this purpose. Still, you can use either of them and software stitch the shots later. There might be better programs out there, but I sometimes Microsoft ICE which works for me:

      <message>Hi ruud, hi Dave,

sure! As I see it, the 40mm should get the job done better. The 50mm feels too tight for such situations (unless you are on full frame). If you plan on shooting animals in low light, the 2.8 aperture might be too slow though - especially since animals tend to move when you don't want them to. A standard zoom lens (for flexibility) and an external flash gun (for quick shutter speeds) might serve you better in this case.

And also, there is no "right" or "wrong" here - it all depends on what you are comfortable shooting with. I know myself that I had the 50mm for quite some time without using it much, but the 40mm has basically stayed on since I got it - but that's just me. ;)</message>

      <message>Hi lloyd,

tough one! I have not tried the 1.4 myself, but from what I have heard, the price difference to the cheaper 50mm 1.8 is hard to justify for many. If the price is right and bokeh is your thing, it might be worth going for though. It should be great for portraits.

If possible, ask your friend if you can borrow and try out the lens for a day or two - that should make the decision easier.</message>

      <message>Hi Erik,

I'm looking to get another lens other than my kit lens for the Rebel T2i that I own.  I'm mainly wanting to use it to shoot newborn and child photography.  I thought about just picking up the Prime 50mm lens since it's so inexpensive, but after reading your review I'm thinking the 40mm pancake lens is the way to go. In your opinion, which one do you think is better for newborn photography (mainly indoor) the 50 or the 40? And is there another "all purpose" lens that you can recommend I add that would also be good to have other than the kit lens and the prime lens? (I was thinking the Canon EF 24-105mm f/4, but feel it may be to heavy duty for what I need it for)

Thanks so much!

      <message>@Sally: The 50mm is a must for any canon user according to some, so do feel free to pick it up! The shallow depth of field and the slight fuzziness fully open can really create some magic. Personally, I still prefer the 40mm though, mostly because of its more usable focal length and build quality.

For an all-purpose lens, consider the Canon 15-85. Its weight and zoom range should be more fit for an APS sensor camera than the 24-105, and it's cheaper (although still a bit pricey). You might want to google some reviews to see if it's for you.

@razu: I prefer the 40mm, it's very sharp and has rounder bokeh. It's also smaller and focuses more quietly.</message>

      <message>Hi Erik

I have been using 50mm for a few months, until I dropped it and it parted into 2. I'm really into travel photography and 50mm hardly was of ne use as its angle was too narrow and if I focus an object close by the background is barely visible at 1.8 fstop. Though the 'object' comes out to b real awesum. Sharpness is an issue in long distance shots. And I find it too bright in daylight even at iso 100. For travel Its of no good. But for portraits its unmatched. 
How's 40mm for travel, long shots, and how wide is it?</message>

      <message>@kenneth: The 40mm is sharper and faster, but it lacks optical image stabilizer and also zoom. In that sense, it's not a pure upgrade since there are tradeoffs. If you think the 40mm will suit your needs, by means, go for it. But if you feel that zoom and IS are important, consider a quality zoom lens instead.

      <message>Hi Logan,

I hope the 40mm has what you are looking for. Since I got it, it has stayed on the camera much longer than the 50mm ever did - definitely a good sign.</message>

      <message>Thank you so much!!

This thing with canon 50 mm also happened to me. It just fell apart. I got very sad because I had it only for 5 days and at that time I went for a vacation, so I couldn't take photos. 
After your article I realized that it wasn't my fault and thank you for good advice! </message>

      <message>@Zajden: thank you, glad you like it!

@Jane: yes, the build quality of the 50mm is very poor. Luckily, after mine feel apart, I was able to push the two pieces back together and it has been working since.

@Aniruddha: the 50mm has a focal length suitable for portrait photography on your camera and offers great bang for the buck. Just be careful not to drop it! The 40mm should also work well, but will not be able to blur the background as much. For nature photography, neither is very suitable. You will probably need a good quality zoom lens that's wide enough for landscape shots. The Canon 15-85 is a good general purpose lens that should work well for you. Have fun!</message>

      <message>Thought I'd chime in with my recommendation for those with  full-frame cameras. If I'm indoors, the 50 is on due to it's larger aperture. If I'm out and about, it's the 40 due to the size. I feel the loss of aperture is a fair trade for the compactness. That said, for most portraits I prefer my 85/1.8 or the 50 in a pinch because to 40 distorts faces too much. So, as you can see, there's a place for both lenses with a full-frame body. I had a cropped body before and used the 40 for a walk-around normal lens and the 50 for my portraits.</message>

      <message>Hi Erik,

Firstly, great article!!

I have a Canon 600D too and as it is evident I am confused between the 50mm and the 40mm lens.

I do a lot of low light photography, pet photography(my dog is my fav. subject), children photography (during their workshops, in side a room and loads of movement) and landscapes.

I have the standard 18-55 and 55-250mm lenses, could you suggest which one of the two 40mm and 50mm will be more suitable for my photography style?

Thanks!!</message>

      <message>@Sanchit: Sorry for the late reply! Neither the 40mm nor the 50mm is very suited for landscape shots, but both are good for portraits, especially on a crop body. You may benefit some from the faster aperture of the 50mm if you shoot in low light and want to freeze action. Otherwise, keep the lenses you have and get a flash instead (preferably one with a swivel head for light bouncing).

@David: thank you for your interest in this article! The aperture in that shot is f/2.8, with a shutter speed of 1/400th, at ISO 100.</message>

      <message>Hi Bob,

in my opinion, neither can focus close enough to be used for serious macro photography. Also, macro lenses are typically a bit longer, usually equivalent to 100mm. But if I have to choose one over the other, it would be the 40mm since it can focus a bit closer as shown in the macro shot in the article. Hope this helps!</message>

      <message>Hi Erik,

Great page! 

I need your opinion here.

I have been recently robbed and now I'm purchasing my equipment again and think I think about buying two lenses (primes).

50mm 1.8+85mm 1.8 (I read great thing regarding the 85mm and I had the 50mm with nice results, but think that 85mm and 50mm will be some kind of "close")

40mm 2.8+85mm 2.8 (I read nice things regarding the pancake and think even it is slower it has the half focal lenght than the 85mm which is also faster).

Also, I really like models, beauty and "people" shooting so think that 40mm + 85mm will be a good option to shoot close portraits and mid body photos.

What do you think?

Thanks and greetings from Argentina :)

      <message>Hi Emiliano,

sorry to hear you got robbed, hope you are OK!

About the lenses, if you have used the 50mm before and liked it, I see no problem picking it up again. The focal length is great for portraits on a crop body and it can produce a very shallow depth of field to make the subject stand out. But I understand what you mean, and also feel that the 50mm and 85mm might be a bit close. So if you are getting the 85mm anyway, I also think the 40mm would be the better companion. The compactness is also a nice plus.

However, personally I feel that 85mm is a bit to long on a crop sensor for portraits. Have you considered the 50mm for portraits, and using something 30mm-ish for full body shots or as a walk around lens?</message>

      <message>Canon has a 28mm f/1.8 and Sigma a 30mm f/1.4, either one should probably be okay in your case. By looking at some reviews, it seems that many lean slightly towards the Canon. Both lenses cost more than the 40mm pancake, but the price point is still within reason. 

Please be aware that I don't own either of these lenses, or the 85mm! You might want to read some reviews before blindly following my advice. ;)</message>

      <message>Hi abhijeet,

the kit lens you already own, the 18-55, is pretty OK for indoor and landscape much thanks to is reasonably wide angle. Neither of these two lenses are very wide and may be awkward to use. For street however, I would prefer the 40mm for more compactness. As already mentioned, it's also very sharp. Hope this helps!</message>

      <message>Hi Agness,

the 50mm can create a nice, blurry background with its shallow depth of field, so is great for portraits. And it's cheap too! Start using the kit lens first (at the long end), if you feel that it doesn't deliver on portraits, the 50mm is a cheap upgrade and usually well worth it.</message>

As per my experience. 50mm will give you perfect results as you desire when there's more light. 
So, as per my requirement what do you suggest, 40mm or 50mm?  I own 550D with kit lens and i'm thinking to also buy 75-300mm lens:</message>

Can you also guide me with 55-250mm f4-5.6 and 75-300mm f4-5.6 one? I have heard 75-300mm is not good. But i'll surely be missing the extra 50mm if I go for 55-250mm! </message>

      <message>Hey, I currently own a 50mm f/1.8 and I demoed the 40mm f/2.8 STM in a store and I really liked the bokeh that the 40mm gave as well as the general image quality and build quality. But I'm worried about the difference between 2.8 and 1.8, especially given my 40D's pathetic ISO performance at 3200. The 1.8 allows me to do night shooting at ISO1600 but will the 2.8 be suitable for me?</message>

      <message>Hi Lee Joonmin,

good question, and I can't seem able to make up my own mind about this!

Maybe you could check the EXIF (metadata) of some of your old shots and see if there might have been room for another stop and a half - maybe your shutter speeds were faster than you think, or the ISO lower. You probably want to stay at a shutter speed of 1/60th to be safe, combined with a f/2.8 aperture and ISO 1600. If you are already pushing it at f/1.8 (lets say ISO 1600 and 1/30th), then f/2.8 might be tough. But also note that the shorter focal length helps reduce camera shake slightly at slow shutter speeds, as described in the article.</message>

      <message>Hi Erik I use a Canon 550D and already own a 50mm f/1.8 but I'm not very content with it as the angle of view is a problem when I want to get closer to the subject which usually is my wife and kid. I love to shoot portraits with the softer blur and good bokeh. Which lens would you advise me to go for. I was thinking of 28mm f/2, 40/mm f/2.8 and 35mm f/2. My dire need is portraits and couple shoots producing the softest blur and great bokeh. Also suggest me if any other lenses are better of than I mentioned above around the same budget.

      <message>Hi Nitish,

while I like the 40mm, I have the feeling it might be a bit too long in your case - and I am afraid I don't have any hands on experience with the other lenses you are considering. I do have an old 28mm lens though, and I find the focal length quite useful so personally I would look into that. By the way, have you considered the Sigma 18-35 f/1.8? That way, you have a quite flexible solution and don't have to stick to a single focal lenght.</message>

      <message>Hi dimgeo,

well, as always, it depends! The two lenses are not dramatically different; both have a fixed focal length and are good for portraits. While image quality is good with both, the fixed focal length is often limiting. Try setting the kit lens to 40 or 50 mm and see what it's like. If it feels comfortable, well, I prefer the superior build quality of the 40 mm. If you will shoot in dim light, the large aperture of the 50 mm will probably serve you better, however.</message>

      <message>Hi Chan,
The ISO performance of the 1100D is not all too shabby, so I think I would have gone for compactness instead of speed, meaning taking the 40mm. If you feel otherwise (you probably have the kit lens already - does it feel slow in the short end?), the 50 mm would enable faster shutter speeds.</message>

A shorter lens is usually more convenient if you have little space, but also will be less flattering to the model. You might want to get the cheaper 50mm and then a flash gun for off-camera flash - it might get tight, but at least you have good light!</message>

      <message>Hi Neto,

today, I think I would rather go for the 24mm. I like the 40mm, but my main gripe is the slightly too long focal length. 24mm on a crop body should be very versatile. Anyway:

1. Lots of bokeh. Good for portraits and isolating subjects.
2. Good for travel thanks to small size and build quality. Also good for portraits.
3. Just as small as the 40mm. Better for general use and as walkaround lens because wider, less so for portraits. 

I don't have the 24mm so I'm guessing a bit here. But it certainly looks pretty good!</message>

Can you help me with this and is the 40mm the one for this types of picture, would it be a good purchase for what I want? I appreciate if you can get back to me asap because Im about to buy it and Im all the way in colombia so I wont be able to return it if it doesn work for me.!!! Thank you so much!</message>

don't worry, getting used to new equipment takes time! You can try a few tricks with the lens you already have for more blur:

1. Make sure the mode dial is in Av (aperture priority) mode and that the aperture is fully open - meaning the smallest possible number.
2. The further the subject is from the backdrop, the stronger the blurring effect.
3. Use longer focal lengths. At 135mm, the effect should be more noticeable. Try shooting twice with the same composition, one at the shortest focal length (18mm) and one at the longest (135mm).

For night shots, stick to a large aperture and a short focal length and make sure the optical stabilizer (IS) is on. Consider using a tripod, or improvise one - for example, put the camera on a rock and use the 2 second timer.

The 40mm is good for portraits and should give you a little more blur. It is, however, only marginally faster than the 18-135 and it lacks IS, so it is not a given choice for night photography.

Hope this helps!</message>

      <message>Hello Erik,
first of all,I'd like to thank you for the reviews and photo samples,very professional!Could you please give me an advise for my case - I am a painter and I'd like to take "print-size" photos of my paintings. So my studio is very small (about 4x 4,5 m) and I am wondering which kind of lenses to choose.My camera is Canon 60D, the other lenses I have is Canon 17-55/2.8  Thank you very much in advance! </message>

      <message>Hi Drago,

thank you! You will want to avoid distortion as much as possible, so you would probably want a fairly long quality lens, and you should stand back as far as you can. Also, a tripod helps. You might want to experiment with the lens that you have to find out far you will able to stand back and how long the lens can be (it also depends on the size of the paintings). If 50mm feels OK, you can get away with the cheap Plastic Fantastic - it should produce very little distortion and stopped down a bit, it is razor sharp.</message>

      <message>Many thanks for answering,
I tried one Plastic Fantastic and the result is..hm,ok.I think in the center it's sharp as hell, but at the corners it isnt what I want.My biggest paintings are 60x40 cm, so the 2-3 meters from target is an excellent distance	
for shooting, with a solid tripod that I use. So, you said 40mm is sharp in whole picture and I am really interested in it.The bad thing is that I can't find one for test shoots, just have to blind-buying it...

      <message>Hi, lizzy

hard to say! Neither of the lenses here are particularly great for macro. The 40mm might have an edge because it focuses a bit faster, and you can also let the lens auto-focus and then adjust the focus manually without changing any settings. This can be useful if the subject is moving around a lot.

You already have some decent gear there, think about what is really missing. If you like the flexibility of a zoom lens, you might want to stick to your guns. If you need more light and more bokeh, either of these should be good fun.</message>

      <message>Hi,

I recently got the 600D, kit lens, and the 50mm/1.8 lens, but I feel like it is too long for indoor shooting.  I still have the option to return it, would the 40mm or the 24mm pancake be a better option?

This is my first DSLR and I'm still new to photography.  Perhaps the kit lens would be good enough? What do you think?</message>

      <message>Hi Ray,

the 50mm definitely feels awkward indoors with an APS size sensor. But if you are aware if its limitations, it can be both fun to use and produce great results, especially for portraits. That said, the 24mm will most probably be more versatile. If you find yourself shooting close to the short range of the kit lens most of the time, the 24mm should provide better quality in a smaller package. Otherwise, just keep experimenting and learning with the 50mm. It might be a challenge to use sometimes, but in the right situation and some practice, it certainly delivers.</message>

      <message>(Cont.)...for photographing my young kids who are, as expected, on the move all the time - 40mm or 50mm? I've had the 50mm for just under a year and have been very happy with the pic quality, although I have struggled getting the focus right on a few occasions (blurred or not focusing on more than one subject - I shoot on automatic and scene - portrait). Yesterday I dropped the 50mm lens, hence the decision to replace it with the same lens or try something a little different (40mm). 

I look forward to hearing from you. </message>

      <message>Hi Dale,

subjectively, the 40mm tends to hunt for focus a bit less and also, it can take a bit of a beating! Unlike the 50mm, which fell apart after I dropped it - luckily I was able to push it back together again. So I think the 40mm might be a good option for you. Hope this helps!</message>

Congratulations on the excellently written article. I need an advice from you. I have a Canon 1000D with 18-135 IS Lens. Additionally, I have a 40mm 2.8 STM with it. I generally prefer Street/General photography. Plz suggest me whether should I stick with the 40mm or look for the 50mm 1.8 or the 24mm 2.8? Moreover, can you please through a brief light about the merits of 24mm, 40mm and 50mm? Expecting a quick reply.</message>

      <message>Hi Dip,

thanks! Well I think it depends on your shooting style and where you feel the 40mm lacks. If you feel that it's too tight, the 24mm might be a better choice. With 24mm, for street photography, you will need to get closer to your subject, which might be a good thing. With the 50mm you may have to step back a bit, and it will also give a more shallow depth of field. However, the 50mm is not quite as compact, and has a sub par build quality.</message>

      <message>hello Erik,

about the fact that the system "kicks in" and freezes the image. I just bought this same lense, and when focussing, the image in the viewfinder actually moves a fraction to the left down corner, and when releasing it again (without taking the shot) it moves back again. Do you notice the same effect happening?

      <message>Hi Jan,

not sure it's the same thing as you describe, but with the camera on a tripod and image stabilization turned on, after focusing - and that's when the IS kicks in - it starts drifting around quite a bit. It keeps on doing that until the IS is deactivated after a few seconds. The effect is very noticeable at the long end and using live view. The stabilizer tries to correct errors that don't exist and end up creating errors on its own. It's normal for this type of lens; IS only works for fairly quick shutter speeds anyway, and makes no sense on a tripod. But it still looks weird. ;)</message>

      <message>Thanks a lot for your comparsion Erik.

So as i see it the 50mm will not do good photos on f/1.8 if handheld,
so its better to go for the 40mm pancake.

and i read in your comparsion between the 40mm and 50mm that the 40mm pancake does not have stabilizer, how important is the stabilizer, for this lens?

      <message>Hi Hashim,

thank you for you comment. The reason why the 50mm is so blurry wide open is not because it's handheld in this case, but simply because it's not sharp at a fully open aperture (ie. not because of slow shutter speeds).

Regarding image stabilization, I blogged about that quite a while ago. I used the kit lens at 55mm and shot with and without IS at different shutter speeds. In conclusion, IS helps quite a bit (but of course, only if the scene is static). Read here:

http://www.erikmoberg.net/article/canon_image_stabilizer_is_test

For indoor low light shooting, if you stay at 18mm, you will not notice much difference to the 40mm. The 50mm is quite a bit faster and could suit better, if you can live with (or prefer) that fuzzy look it produces wide open. Still, it may not be able to freeze action (like kids moving around), so if that's your thing, hold on to that lens and get an external flash instead.

Happy shooting!</message>

thank you! :)

I do not own both lenses so I cannot make a comparison myself. However, both lenses have good enough quality, so maybe just skip the IQ question for now. The 40mm is very compact and much lighter, which is what you are actually looking for - if you are willing to sacrifice the zoom, of course.</message>

      <message>Hi again ClaesP,

I'm afraid I haven't! I read some reviews of the 35mm and while it seems a tad more usable - having IS, larger aperture, and a visible focal scale - it's also larger, heavier and several times more expensive than the 40 mm. Sharpness should be about the same, possibly with the 35mm stopped down some. </message>

      <message>Great comparison! Thank you!!!

I've been scouring the net for a couple of weeks now trying to get as much information about theses lenses as possible. Now I'm getting the 40mm thanks to you!

I'm a newbie to photography and my greatest frustration is that I can't capture on camera what I see with my eyes. Impossible demand? Yes. That's the reason why I'm shopping around for a new lens but something that does not break my wallet. (I also am aware of the "you get what you pay for" adage so lets not go there. :) )

So now I'm honing my technical skills on the kit lens and composition skills on the 40mm.

      <message>Thans for your reviews, very useful.

Could you comment on the landscape shots?   The water and sky don't pick up the blues on th 40 like the other lenses.  </message>

      <message>@David: For some reason, seems like the camera underexposed that shot by one stop. That would probably explain why the shade of the sky is different. I used aperture priority with auto ISO for all shots, so blame the 600D. ;)

@Nathanation: Sounds great, have fund with the lens!</message>

      <message>no more thinking. I am going to get a 40mm 2.8 STM and sell my 50mm 1.8.     I could not really get friends with the 50mm 1.8.   </message>

      <message>I've been interested in the 40mm since I started last year. I ended up getting the 50mm as I needed a fast prime for an event, I do like the 50 but understand the issue with softness at 1.8.

The lowest I ever go is f2.8, I also find the 50mm is way too tight for me and not compact enough considering the 50mm is my lightweight travel setup. The noise from the AF motor is pretty silly aswell. 

Decided I'm going to sell my 50mm and get the 40mm. Good job I slapped a cheap uv filter on it when I bought it and have babied it for the few months i've owned it so it's still in mint condition, should get my money back and invest some more into the 40mm and get what I wanted in the first place.

Thanks for helping me confirm my decision. :)</message>

      <message>@Andy: Glad to help!

@abhishek: Neither of these are very good landscape or macro lenses, but great for portraits. The 50mm is a bit cheaper and faster, while the 40mm is more compact, has superior build quality and costs a little more. You can read more here:

      <message>Thanks for the very nice article! My pancake is coming soon! Anyway, do you know how's the effect of lens filter on the 40mm? Should it be covered (hood or filter) or let it be free? What is the best filter which will not ruined the image quality?

      <message>Hi Amin,

Happy you liked it!

I don't use any filters or lens hoods on any of my lenses and I have never had any problems. I feel that lens hoods mostly add bulk (especially with this small lens it would), and even a high quality filter does degrade the quality some. The front element of the 40mm is not very exposed anyway so it's not really in need of protection.</message>

      <message>Hello Erik,
Truely well done comparison. I am going to go on a cruise around sunset. the photos will be both landscape and portrait. I expect the lighting to be low for portraits. What would you recommend, 18-55 MM kits lens or the 50mm prime</message>

      <message>HI Erik,
It seems like 40mm pancake lens is much superior than canon 1.8, but would u tell me which one will be better for low light and concert photography.

      <message>Better late reply than never, I guess...

@Vaibhav: I think you should bring both! The 50mm is great for portraits and low-light photography, but with the kit lens you will be being able to get wide sunset shots as well.

@satish: The 50mm is definitely faster so it's better on many low-light situations. But 50mm seems a bit short for concerts, no? You might want to look into a fast tele lens with image stabilizer. The Tamron mentioned in the post is OK, but probably too slow.

      <message>I have a Canon DSLR 1200D. I intend to buy an inexpensive prime lens. I have been told that Canon 24mm 2.8f STM works better in such cropped body camera. My prime interest is in street photography and portrait. Please advise. </message>

      <message>Hi Uttam,

The 24 mm is said to be a great lens too - compact, sharp and good build quality. It should also be well suited as a street photo lens, where the 40 mm might be a bit tight at times (depending on situation and shooting style). However, the shorter focal length will lead to less background blur, and also distortion - expect large noses on subject when doing close portraits. </message>

      <message>Thanks Erik. Will it be reasonably ok in low lights too. I am still undecided if I should go for 50mm 1.8f or the 24mm 2.8f STM one. Would appreciate your views.

      <message>Hi Uttam,

tough one! I do find myself shooting more with the 40mm, also in low light - and I usually find it fast enough. Of course, the 50mm is a bit faster, and makes for nice artsy late night street shots. If you are specifically going for low-light without flash, then the 50mm might be the better choice. </message>

      <message>San Disk is one of the best manufacturing companies for micro SD card. I do agree with you; last time I was also using micro SD card and I faced great problem due to it. Then, I started to use SD card of company Easy replication and I had never face any problem.</message>

      <message>Hi Maktor,

glad to be of help! I don't have the keyboard anymore, but I found the trackball a tad small and light to comfortably work with. I have two cheap Logitech trackballs here with much better ergonomics and precision. I still found it OK for controlling a media PC or for a short gaming session, but for extended, sustained use, you might want to look elsewhere.</message>
