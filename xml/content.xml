Note that it uses liquid layout, making the contents fill out the whole page.

    <intro>Apparently, there is a way of embedding videos using some function offered by my web host. Can't get it to work though. I guess I will have to do dome research. In the meantime, just grab a funny video where we sing for Johan using this &lt;a href="videos/johan30.avi"&gt;link.&lt;/a&gt; (17MB)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Edit: Got the embedding to work but it sucked. Just use the link.</intro>

    <intro>As we all know by now, each time someone comes up with something fun (like online banking) someone else always comes up with something even more fun (like phishing). In this case, I just added an admin-interface to this page, effectively turning it into something like a blog. I guess that's a lot of fun until someone hacks the page and inject malicious code into it. Lol.

    <intro>Went on a trip to Paris. Never been there before. Interesting city, even if it all felt somewhat clich√©. Take that Eiffel tower for example. It's not exactly like you go all "wow, look they got a tower, I had no idea". But I still have to admit that the city - including the tower - was very impressive.

    <subheader>
    </subheader>
    <intro>Bought a new camera about a week ago since I got tired of the old one (Casio Z60). Instead of playing it safe and just go with any Canon IXUS (basically, all IXUS cameras provide great bang for the buck) I decided to go for a Ricoh Caplio R7. Featuring 8MP and a 7.1x optical zoom in a very small format, it seemed like a steal for 217 EUR. And so far, I'm very satisfied with it. Here is what I have concluded so far:

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The good:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good color reproduction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;7.1x zoom (can't be bad)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good macro (1cm, or 25cm at full zoom)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Standard mini-usb cable, standard (hc)sd-card&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lots of settings to play around with (including manual focus), easily accessible using the dedicated "adj"-joystick&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The bad:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Somewhat loud (startup, focusing, zooming)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Diagonal lines on display look jagged&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slow focus, unable to focus at times&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Struggles somewhat under low-light conditions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Check out some &lt;a href="/images/16"&gt;sample pictures&lt;/a&gt; from the gallery. Note that all pictures are shot at 3MP (lame, I know).&lt;/p&gt;</intro>

    <intro>Finding the image gallery a bit cumbersome to use, but on the other hand being too lazy to create a new one from scratch, I decided to use &lt;a href="http://vikjavev.no/highslide/"&gt;Highslide JS&lt;/a&gt;. This nice piece of JavaScript software really adds a new dimension to the gallery, making it easier to use and looking great at the same time. It also makes the page feel more - no matter how much I hate the term - Web 2.0.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

    <intro>Haven't added too many pictures to the image gallery lately. Partly because I'm lazy, but mainly because my Ricoh R7 broke. The flimsy lens cover would not open completely and I sent it back. This was the end of June. About a month later, Ricoh sent me a new one back. Funnily, it had almost exactly the same lens cover related problem (in other words, it was DOA) and got sent back as well. So I finally got the camera in the end of August. And it seems to work, too. Nice, had to take all my vacation pictures with my old, half-way broken Casio.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hint of the day: Before considering Ricoh, consider every other brand first.</intro>

Just added some &lt;a href="/images/23"&gt;sample pictures&lt;/a&gt; to the gallery. Nothing fancy but it should give you some idea of what the camera can do (all with the standard lens).
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I won't write any review or so, but for anyone wondering - the LiveView feature is not just some gimmick, it's actually very convenient (just make sure to get the focus right - the camera does not auto-focus in this mode).
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Recommended. :)</intro>

    <intro> [image tower] Just came back from a trip to the Middle East and Asia. I have noticed that some people complain about Dubai; the city apparently has no "soul" and there is really nothing to do there. I found it to be a very diverse city with tons to do. We went for some dune bashing in the desert, a cruise along the creek and, of course, sightseeing and shopping.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
We continued on to Bangkok, which turned out to be just as big and colorful as expected.

    <header>Dingoo A320 - First impressions</header>
    <readableid>dingoo_a320_-_first_impressions</readableid>
    <subheader>Portable retro gaming</subheader>
    <intro> [image dingoo_front] Portable gaming is more popular than ever. Devices like the Nintendo DS and Sony PSP seem to be everywhere, and so are the games with fast graphics, network support, and whatnot. If you are like me, however, you may find that the best games have already been made - a long time ago.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Enter the Dingoo A320 - the "other" portable gaming console. Capable of playing back videos, play mp3s, and much more, its primary function is to emulate older games. Remember the NES, SNES and Genesis? Those were *real* consoles. ;)</intro>
    <content>&lt;p&gt;
Since I was going to China, I decided to pick up one of the devices there. It did take some time to find one, however, and most people had no clue what I was looking for. Many told me that the console was an older model, and pointed me to the new one - apparently, this was the Nintendo DS...
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I did manage to find one at last. Actually slightly overpriced, but still very reasonable at 600 HKD (roughly 60 EUR, or 75 USD).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What bundle?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Opening up the box, we find that there is not much inside. A pair of headphones, a mini USB cable (for charging and data transfer), some RCA cables (for hooking up to your favourite plasma tv) a usb charger and a quick start manual. There are also some documents in chinese. Have difficulties reading them. Hopefully, they contain no important information. ;)
&lt;/p&gt;
[image cables]
&lt;h3&gt;The device&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The console measures 125x55x14mm, which happens to be almost exactly the same as the classic NES controller. Nice and small, in other words. 4GB of memory is built in, and can be expanded using the miniSD-port (yes, miniSD - not microSD). In general, the console looks good, with its glossy (but easily fingerprint-y) finish. The buttons also feel good. I found the placement of the headphone jack to be a slight problem however, since my headphones (not the supplied ones) have a tall straight plug. A bit awkward for the right hand.
&lt;/p&gt;
[image plug]
&lt;h3&gt;Power on&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The unit powers up pretty fast. After a few seconds, the menu pops up. To play a game, select "3D game" or "Interesting game". (Yes, it says that. I believe that you can buy fan t-shirts now saying "Interesting game".) 
&lt;/p&gt;
[image menu]
&lt;p&gt;
Apart from playing games, the console also features a music player, video player, radio, sound recorder, picture viewer, and text reader.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Playing games&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The Dingoo supports out-of-the-box emulation of these platforms: GBA, NES, NeoGeo, SNES, CPS1, CPS2, and Sega Mega Drive/Genesis. C64 and classic Gameboy support would have been nice, but this can be corrected with some tinkering (more on this later).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So far, most games I have tried have worked without any bigger problems. Emulation is not perfect, however - performance is lacking on some platforms. For example, Snes emulation is a bit weak. Many games just feel sluggish and the background music slows down as well. Slow-paced games work well, however. 3D graphics on the GBA are also slow. As long as the games stick to 2D graphics, all is fine though.
&lt;/p&gt;
[image 7days]
&lt;p&gt;
If you were too lazy to read the quick start manual, it could be helpful to know that holding the start and select buttons brings up the emulator menu, where you can save the game state, adjust frame skip, and more. I guess adjusting the frame skip could help performance some, but I had little luck with it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Other features&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Video player, mp3 player and fm radio are all quite basic but all get the job done. Not so much to say here. The Dingoo is a bit too big to fit in a pocket so its not replacing my mp3 player anytime soon. As a video player, it could be an option though. The 2.8" monitor is enough for watching cartoons, full length movies are another story.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;But does it run Linux?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Uhm... yes. A version of Linux, called Dingux, can be installed on the machine. Using Dingux, more applications and emulators can be run. I will install and test it as soon as I have time. I am hoping to find a Snes emulator that performs better, and apparently, a C64 emulator is available.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Final words&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Small device with tons of features and a reasonable price - easy to recommend, despite some flaws. With some tinkering, I am hoping to get even more out of it. :)

    <subheader>Cheapskate photography</subheader>
    <intro> [image long_lens] I got a Canon 1000D some time ago, but I still use the kit lens. Simple reason is, good lenses are quite expensive. Luckily, there is a solution, and it's called M42. Using an adapter, old lenses using the M42 mount can be fitted onto almost any modern SLR. I decided to get an adapter, and shortly after, I got some lenses from a friend so I could try it out. If you like to save some money and don't mind working in (almost) full manual mode, this is something for you.</intro>
    <content>&lt;p&gt;
The M42 screw mount was introduced in the late 30's and was used well into the 80's. Most of the lenses where quite simple with no special functions - just metal, glass and mechanics. Today, used M42 lenses can easily be found online or at flea markets - or just take a look in your own basement (I happened to have an old analog camera lying around there, and guess the mount type?).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Adapters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Getting an adapter should be easy and not expensive. Check eBay. Just make sure to get the right type for your camera. The adapter screws onto the M42 lens and you can then mount it on the camera.
&lt;/p&gt;
[image adapters]
&lt;h3&gt;Lenses&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I picked up some equipment here and there. In total, I paid 12 EUR for everything (around 16 USD).
&lt;/p&gt;
[image lenses]
&lt;h3&gt;Focusing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
These things lack auto focus and since my Canon (like many other modern DSLRs) are not really made for manual focus lenses, getting tack sharp shots is a pain. Older cameras had focusing aids for this, like a split circle in the viewfinder that fit together when you had focus. With the Canon, the only way that really works - unless you want to install a new optical viewfinder - is to use the LiveView and zoom in as much as possible. If the subject is moving or the light is low, this takes a lot of patience and the results depend a lot on luck. A steady tripod helps.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Aperture setting&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The aperture works in an interesing way. Since there are no electronics involved, the aperture is closed by a pin. When the shutter is pressed, a small metal plate pushes the pin in and the aperture closes. This enables easy focusing since the aperture can be wide open. Now, modern lenses don't have this pin, and the same goes for the cameras. So instead, to close the aperture, you will have to push a button on the lens (kinda like the aperture preview) or lock the aperture by setting it to manual. Not all lenses have a lock, which means you will have to push the button yourself - difficult when using a tripod. When shooting, set the camera to aperture value so it sets the shutter speed itself.
&lt;/p&gt;
[image aperture]
&lt;p&gt;
Apart from that, I have noticed that the aperture is almost extreme on some lenses. The 135mm goes from 2.8 and the 55mm from 1.8. At these settings, however, focusing is next to impossible.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Macro photography&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Using the 55mm lens and the extension tubes, we get nice and (mostly) sharp results.
&lt;/p&gt;
[image macro_1]
[image macro_1_crop]
[image macro_2]
[image macro_2_crop]
[image macro_3]
[image macro_3_crop]
&lt;p&gt;
The 55mm itself produces good results, and with one or two extension tubes, makes a decent macro lens. Of course, this varies from lens to lens. I had another 50mm lens with always produced very blurry results, and this one is much better.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Getting in tight&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Using the short tele and two tele converters should be interesting. I decided to go to the park and try to shoot some birds. Getting close enough with the standard lens (18-55mm) is difficult.
&lt;/p&gt;
[image zoom_18]
[image zoom_135]
[image zoom_135_crop]
[image zoom_1conv]
[image zoom_1conv_crop]
[image zoom_2conv]
[image zoom_2conv_crop]
&lt;p&gt;
The 135mm itself produces sharp pictures, but with each teleconverter, it gets worse. Exposure time suffers also, and the camera seems to have difficulties measuring the light properly. Not the worst results ever, but I think I will ditch the teleconverters and pick up a longer lens instead.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you like photography but don't like spending the cash, try it. Cost is very low and the results are often interesting. But since focusing is do difficult, it is still a bit hard to recommend.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Pros:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cheap&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Macro shots turn out very well&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will definitely learn a lot of stuff&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trains your patience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Cons:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focusing very frustrating&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lenses are heavy (usually metal casing)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zoom lenses may be a bit difficult to find&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <header>Canon Image Stabilizer (IS) test</header>
    <readableid>canon_image_stabilizer_is_test</readableid>
    <subheader>Shaken, not blurred</subheader>
    <intro> [image is] Many lenses today come with optical image stabilizers (in Canon's case, IS for short) to help producing sharp pictures when shooting in low-light conditions. Useful when a tripod is not an option. However, lenses with IS are typically more expensive than their non-IS counterparts. So how much does IS help, and is it worth the extra $$$?</intro>
    <content>&lt;h2&gt;Setup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
All pictures were shot using a Canon 1000D with the kit lens (Canon 18-55 mm EF-S 3.5-5.6 IS). ISO was set to 100 and camera was set to time value (shutter priority). No special techniques were used (like &lt;a href="http://lifehacker.com/5370412/breathe-like-a-sniper-to-take-better-photos-in-low-light"&gt;sniper breathing&lt;/a&gt;), just holding the camera normally and looking through the optical viewfinder.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started with the shutter set to 1/60, and then went through 1/30, 1/15, 1/10, 1/5 and 1/2, shooting 20 pictures using each setting; 10 with IS activated and 10 without IS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is a sample shot, the crops at all settings follow.&lt;/p&gt;
[image all]
&lt;h2&gt;Crops&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For each setting, I selected one picture that I felt was the most representative one; the one with an average amount of blur. These are shown below.&lt;/p&gt;

[image 60_is]
[image 60_no_is]
[image 30_is]
[image 30_no_is]
[image 15_is]
[image 15_no_is]
[image 10_is]
[image 10_no_is]
[image 5_is]
[image 5_no_is]
[image 0.5_is]
[image 0.5_no_is]

&lt;h2&gt;Useful pictures&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I evaluated each picture and put together a table showing how many of them I subjectively found "good enough" - that is, a picture that is not so badly blurred that I would normally just delete it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Shutter&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th style="padding-left: 12px"&gt;With IS&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th style="padding-left: 12px"&gt;Without IS&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr style="text-align: right"&gt;&lt;td&gt;1/60&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;100%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;100%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr style="text-align: right"&gt;&lt;td&gt;1/30&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;100%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;90%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr style="text-align: right"&gt;&lt;td&gt;1/15&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;100%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;70%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr style="text-align: right"&gt;&lt;td&gt;1/10&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;100%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;10%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr style="text-align: right"&gt;&lt;td&gt;1/5&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;90%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;0%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr style="text-align: right"&gt;&lt;td&gt;1/2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;60%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;0%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even at very slow shutter speeds (half a second), most of the pictures came out acceptable when IS was turned on. Without IS, the limit seems to be around 1/15th, after which most pictures become useless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all: Optical image stabilization works. I had my doubts, and I was surprised by my own findings. Secondly, is it worth paying extra for? I did a quick check online, and I found that the non-IS version of my lens is only about 20 EUR cheaper than the IS one. In that case, it's a no-brainer, just get IS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you prefer to use a tripod anyway, no need to invest in IS. Apparently (I haven't tested it myself), when using a tripod, using IS may lead to worse results than not using it.
&lt;/p&gt;

Gimp stands for "GNU Image Manipulation Program". The software is available for several platforms (including Windows) and is often found on Linux machines. Some call Gimp a free Photoshop alternative. I call Photoshop an expensive Gimp alternative. ;)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To download Gimp, go to &lt;a href="http://www.gimp.org/"&gt;Gimp.org&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Doing some editing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Open the image with Gimp.
&lt;/p&gt;
[image 00_original]
&lt;p&gt;
In this tutorial, we will take a stab at making the above picture look cool. (Or at least different.)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Go to the layers dialog. If is not shown, go to Windows -&gt; Dockable Dialogs -&gt; Layers and it should pop up. Duplicate the layer by selecting it and clicking the "Create duplicate" button at the bottom.
&lt;/p&gt;
[image 01_copy]
[image 02_copied]
&lt;p&gt;Now, go to Colors -&gt; Desaturate. Tick one of the options - whichever you like the best - and click ok. Congratulations - you now have a grayscale image.&lt;/p&gt;
[image 03_grayscale]
[image 04_goat_gray]
&lt;p&gt;Looks a bit dull, doesn't it? To make the image more rich in contrast, we will adjust the levels a bit. Go to Colors -&gt; Levels.&lt;/p&gt;
[image 05_color_levels]
&lt;p&gt;Adjust the sliders under the histogram. The left slider controls the black level, the one to the right the white level and the one in the middle the gray. Move the white and black sliders closer to the middle to get more contrast.&lt;/p&gt;
[image 06_goat_contrast]
&lt;p&gt;Some sepia touch would be neat. Go to Colors -&gt; Colorize. Select a hue (around 35 is yellow-ish) and drop the saturation a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
[image 08_goat_sepia]
&lt;p&gt;Now for the fun part. Lets make a part of the picture stand out a little. Add a layer mask to the upper layer by right-clicking it and selecting "Add layer mask".&lt;/p&gt;
[image 09_add_layer_mask]
&lt;p&gt;Select to use full opacity and click ok. An invisible mask (it can be made visible, however) has now been added to the layer, which will determine what part of the layer are transparent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Select a brush and set the color to black. Paint some on the carrot. You will notice that by painting, you are in effect erasing parts from the upper layer, making the lower layer (with color) partially visible.&lt;/p&gt;
[image 10_goat_carrot_not_done]
&lt;p&gt;Continue until you have painted the whole carrot. Tip: If you paint outside the carrot, you can easily correct it by panting over your mistake using a white brush, restoring the opacity.&lt;/p&gt;
[image 11_goat_carrot_done]
&lt;p&gt;To make the carrot stand out a little more, we use the levels tool again. First, select the lower layer and then open the levels dialog (Colors -&gt; Levels). Adjust the sliders until the colors look strong enough.&lt;/p&gt;
[image 13_done]
&lt;p&gt;So there you go. You can use this technique on many pictures. Gimp does not require goats. ;)&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <intro>I am using Windows 7 at the time, and it's set up to backup some "important" files to an external hard drive on a regular basis. The other day, Windows kept telling me that the backup failed, giving the helpful error code 0x810000FF. Google did not provide any real help on this. I did notice, however, that I was low on disk space on one of my partitions included in the backup (not the target drive, nor the system partition). Freeing up a couple of GBs did the trick. So maybe the error code should be "insufficient disk space" or something. But then again, hex looks cooler.</intro>

    <header>Getting Linux on that Dingoo</header>
    <readableid>getting_linux_on_that_dingoo</readableid>
    <subheader>Dingoo + Linux = Dingux</subheader>
    <intro> [image dingux_booting] In a &lt;a href="/article/dingoo_a320_-_first_impressions"&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;, I mentioned that installing a version of Linux (called Dingux) on the portable gaming console Dingoo A320 was possible. Well, I finally got around to do it - and I don't regret it. Installation was fairly easy, and a lot of applications and games can now be used on the unit. Even Quake works!</intro>
    <content>&lt;h2&gt;Why Linux?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
First off, just the sheer idea of running Linux on this little thing is interesting. But it goes beyond that - if you have ever missed an emulator in the original firmware, it is almost guaranteed to be found here. Some examples include the Atari 2600, Commodore 64, ScummVM and DOS (dosbox). And Doom (PrBoom) runs flawlessly.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Oh, and be aware that attempting to install Dingux will void your warranty and kill your cat. So be careful. If the installation should fail and your Dingoo will end up bricked... tough luck. There are unbricker programs available, but nothing of this is guaranteed to work.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What you need&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Dingux will be installed on a memory card, so you will need a MiniSD card (or MicroSD with an adapter) with at least 1GB. Larger is better, and cards up to 8GB in size should be compatible.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Secondly, you will need two pieces of software:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;The dual boot installer.&lt;/b&gt; This enables the Dingoo to boot from the original firmware, or from an image on the SD card. Get it from &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/dingoo-linux/downloads/list"&gt;Dingoo-Linux on Google Code.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dingux Local Pack.&lt;/b&gt; This is the actual Dingux image. There are at least two different ones, I used the one from toddler. It comes with a nice menu, a lot of games and emulators. At the time of writing, the most recent version is 0.35. Find the latest bits from &lt;a href="http://boards.dingoonity.org/dingux-games-and-homebrew/"&gt;Dingoonity Forums&lt;/a&gt;. Look for Local Pack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Let's get started!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I recommend you use the comprehensive &lt;a href="http://www.dingoo-scene.com/TheCompleteidiotsGuidetoDinguxWindoze.htm"&gt;Complete Idiot's Guide To Install Dingux&lt;/a&gt;. But instead of the files referred to in the guide (some of which no longer exist), use the files you downloaded in the previous step.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One of the first steps is to connect the Dingoo to your PC and install the drivers from the dual boot package. Windows 7 users will (most likely) get an error message saying that the drivers cannot be installed since they are unsigned. One solution is to just use WinXP instead (which I did). But unsigned drivers can be installed under Windows 7 as well. One way is to reboot the machine, and before Windows starts to load, bring up the Windows boot options by pressing F8. Select "Disable Driver Signature Enforcement" and you will be able to install the drivers. Be aware that since I used Windows XP myself for installing the software, I cannot say if the rest of the flashing process actually works under Windows 7.
&lt;/p&gt;
[image boot_unsigned]
&lt;h2&gt;Got Dingux installed?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hopefully, using the guide and the files above, the installation went smoothly. The original firmware should start if you just start the Dingoo normally, and by holding Select while starting or resetting the unit, Dingux should start.
&lt;/p&gt;
[image menu]
&lt;h2&gt;Optional: Reset mod&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As you use Dingux, you will probably find out pretty quickly that the off switch actually doesn't seem to do anything. You can turn off the console from the Settings menu, but often, it is impractical or even impossible to get there. Therefore, you will be forced to reset the console a lot. To press the reset button, you usually need a pen. If you find that inconvenient, try &lt;a href="http://boards.dingoonity.org/dingoo-hardware-general/dingoo-a320-hardware-modifications-part-2-tiny-screw-as-reset-button/"&gt;making your own button using a screw&lt;/a&gt;. This requires you to take apart the unit, so I'm just carrying around a pen for now.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Actually, I just wanted to play games&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There are quite a few games included in the local pack - more than 50, in fact. These are open source games for Linux; a lot of sidescrollers, space shooters and such, and some remakes of older games (like Great Giana Sisters, or Liero).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Under the "Ports" menu, you will find shortcuts to Duke Nukem 3D, Quake, Hexen, Doom, Wolfenstein, and a few more 3D shooters. If you own the original games, you can just copy over the necessary WAD or PAK files to the appropriate folder and you will be able to play. Wolfenstein and Quake already have their shareware files installed so they are ready to be played. More shareware files can be downloaded from &lt;a href="http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?n31hzdzzwmn"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Wolfenstein, Doom and Duke Nukem run really well. Quake is a bit slow but still quite playable.
&lt;/p&gt;
[image doom]
&lt;p&gt;
As for emulation, it has certainly gotten better. There are a lot of emulators preinstalled, and I haven't had the chance to try all of them yet, but at least I can name a few. Snes games play much better, without the occasional slugginess. And since we now have Atari 2600 emulation, we can finally play ET (gave it a shot... technically, the game works like a charm, but being the worst game ever, it was hardly a satisfying experience). Playing old ScummVM games was a bit tricky using the d-pad instead of a mouse. The sound also stuttered some. Apart from this, it was working well. The GameBoy emulator can play classing (B/W) games and they run smoothly.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I tried using the built-in PDF reader also. The resolution of the screen is the limiting factor here - you will have too zoom and scroll a lot. Documents with complex vector graphics takes some time to load, but otherwise it works quite well.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There is also a simple word processor, in which you use the d-pad in combination with the buttons to type. Quite nifty, and good enough for short messages.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Installing Dingux really opens up a world of possibilities for the Dingoo. A lot of the software (i.e. games) can also be run with none or just some minor tinkering. Recommended. :)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

    <header>Sony Ericsson Xperia X10 Mini Pro hands-on review</header>
    <readableid>sony_ericsson_xperia_x10_mini_pro_hands-on_review</readableid>
    <subheader>Good things come in small packages</subheader>
    <intro> [image open] After Apple showed everyone that big touchscreens are cool and the way of the future, it seems that the phone makers are doing their best to follow. Not necessarily a bad thing, but don't some of us sometimes prefer tactile buttons instead of a flat surface? And can't a phone be high-end without having a 4" screen?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Looking for something more portable but just as usable, the Sony Ericsson X10 Mini Pro caught my eye. The handset is much smaller than the average smartphone and packs a full keyboard. It also comes with the Android 1.6 operating system.</intro>
    <content>&lt;h2&gt;In the box&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The phone comes with a MicroUSB charger and a pair of in-ear headphones. The manual is loaded onto the phone so don't expect any CDs. Included with the phone is also a 2GB MicroSD card, which is already installed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
With 90x52x17mm, the handset is really small. Some may find it a bit thick though. It definitely looks a bit chubby, mainly because it is so short. It weighs in at 120g.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Getting it up and running&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Putting in the SIM card was no problem, no big surprises here. The battery is changeable, which is nothing special but not a given thing nowadays. And speaking of the battery - the battery life is not exactly excellent, and using the phone for surfing and talking will drain the battery fast, sometimes in less than a day. Play around with it less and it should last for at least two days though.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
After putting the SIM card in, I tried to remove it again. This really drove me nuts. There is a movable piece of plastic over the SIM slot which is used to get the SIM card out. However, it only takes it halfway out, and pulling out the card from there was impossible. Using a pair of pliers solved the problem.
&lt;/p&gt;

[image sim]

&lt;h2&gt;The user interface&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As I showed the phone to a friend who also has an Android phone, he asked me what operating system it used. Sony Ericsson came up with a few things to improve the UI, most notable being the shortcuts in the four corners. This gives quick access to messaging, the phone book, music player and call history. These can be replaced by any shortcut from the main menu.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The touchscreen works well most of the time, but sometimes reacts wrongly if you are not careful. I often find myself tapping icons when I want to slide. It's not really worse than most touchscreens, however.
&lt;/p&gt;

[image on]

&lt;h2&gt;Handling contacts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Adding and searching for contacts works as expected and is easy. Being an Android phone, you have the option of syncing contacts with a Google account. Go to contacts and bring up the menu, select Google sync - and it just works.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One complaint though (and a major one) - there seems to be no way to add birthdays to the contacts, and add the birthdays to the calendar with a reminder. A useful feature which my old SE W580i had, left out this time for no apparent reason.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The phone features a 5MP camera with auto focus and an LED flash. The quality is decent and the LED strong, but there are very few settings to play around with. There is auto flash and no flash, and three modes (macro, twilight and sport) that don't really seem to do much. A setting for fill flash would have been useful, and so would a manual ISO setting and exposure compensation. But I guess the camera was made for simple snapshots and for that, it is mostly okay. See sample pictures below.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Web surfing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
With a 2.55" 240x320 pixels display and a single-touch screen, web browsing is a bit awkward at times. Tapping links is often difficult, they are just to small to hit unless you zoom in. The built in browser does a good job though, but you will have to deal with a lot of zooming and scrolling. I was happy to see that YouTube works really well, with no zooming in or out. The keyboard also improves the experience some, making it easy to enter web addresses and typing messages.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Connecting the phone to my WPA2-encrypted wireless network also worked without any problems.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Downloading and using applications&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
One of the strengths of the Android platform is the possibility to download applications (many of them are free) from the Android market place. Just tap the icon in the main menu, type something in the textbox, select the application - it downloads in the background and a shortcut is added to the main menu.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As a retro gaming fan, I was happy to see that some emulators were available, for example for NES and SNES. I tried playing some NES games, which worked perfectly. The keyboard really comes in handy here and eliminates the need for on-screen keys.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Music&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The built-in music player left me disappointed. It seems that you can only play songs by artist, and not by album, genre or anything else. Or more importantly, play by folder. Android market place to the rescue - there is a wide range of free music players available that do the job better.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The supplied headphones are quite good though, no complaints here. And if you disagree: the phone has a standard 3.5mm jack, so feel free to replace them with your favorite ones.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Note: I have the Ultimate Ears MetroFi 220vi with microphone, and they don't seem to work with this handset. There is just no sound coming out of them when they are connected.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The keyboard&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Despite its small size, the keyboard is surprisingly easy to use. Tapping away messages is fast easy, and nothing beats tactile feedback. You need to use two hands a lot of the time though, especially if you use special characters (which are entered by pressing the symbol button and the corresponding key).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pros:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Small size&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Full keyboard which is actually usable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Standard 3.5mm jack, standard MicroSD port, standard MicroUSB port&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Android! (Rumor mill has it that v2 will be coming for this phone soon)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Touchscreen a bit inaccurate at times&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The screen size makes web browsing difficult&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SIM card impossible to remove without tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It's almost impossible not to like this phone - not just because it is small and cute, but also for its capabilities. If you look past the small screen, you will find a very capable Android handset - and using a full tactile keyboard instead of a touch screen when typing is a pleasure.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There is also a non-pro model which retails for around 30 EUR less. It's slightly smaller and quite a bit lighter, but has no keyboard. I'd say go for the keyboard.
&lt;/p&gt;

    <header>Plantronics .Audio 995 vs Creative HS-1200</header>
    <readableid>plantronics_.audio_995_vs_creative_hs-1200</readableid>
    <subheader>Wireless Headset Galore</subheader>
    <intro> [image both] For audio, I have always liked cables. They provide good sound quality, are cheap, and they never tangle or get in the way. Oh wait, they actually do get in the way. A lot. Ever been on Skype when suddenly the "real" phone rings? So you get up and run off to pick up, forgetting about the wires - I actually pulled the cable out of a headset this way once. So if you, like me, have a problem with wires, what wireless alternatives are there? I had a look at two.</intro>
    <content>&lt;h2&gt;The competitors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I have two headsets for this review, the Plantronics .Audio 995 and the Creative HS-1200. They are both sub $100-devices.
&lt;/p&gt;

[image plantronics]

[image creative]

&lt;p&gt;Both headsets are quite small, but the Plantronics are definitely bigger than the Creatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Hooking it up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The Creative headset has a quite unusually looking USB receiver, some kind of wired disc. I guess it is wired so that you can place it in some convenient location, since the other cable attached to it is used for charging and should be kept within reach. A bit ironic actually, you buy a wireless headset and get two cables along with it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Plantronics use a more traditional approach with a normal USB dongle, no wiring here. For charging, a standard mini USB cable is used.
&lt;/p&gt;
[image receivers]
&lt;p&gt;
I tried the units under Windows 7, and they both installed with no problem. Both headsets work as individual audio devices. Windows is only able to send sound to one device at a time however, which could cause inconvenience for some. For example, it means that you cannot have your speakers (connected to the internal soundcard) and the headset (working as its own soundcard) running at the same time. Instead, you will have to use the control panel to switch between them depending on which you want to use. You can setup the headset as the default communication device however, if you only want to use it for Skype and the like.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When charging, the Creatives can still be used. So no need to stop Skyping if you are low on battery, just plug in the charger and carry on. The Plantronics, on the other hand, do not provide this luxury. And neither headset warns you when they are about to run out of juice. Fat minus right there.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Winner: &lt;/b&gt;Creative, thanks to charging-and-using, despite the ugly receiver.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Ergonomics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The Plantronic headset has some kind of mid-sized cups, like they wanted to make them oversized but kinda settled halfway. They are quite comfortable though, but they are not really made for longer (3hrs+) sessions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Creative decided to go for smaller cups whose shape makes you look a bit like Mickey Mouse when wearing them (not sure if that played a part in the design process). They are about as comfortable to wear as the Plantronics though. The cups are a bit to small, but the headband doesn't put as much pressure on them so it just about evens out.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Winner:&lt;/b&gt; Tie.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
Range/Reception
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Both headsets let you go to the next room while Skyping without clicks or pops. Walking outside was more difficult. The Plantronics let me sit on the balcony with just some occasional glitching, while the Creatives garbled away and then went quiet.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I tried placing the USB receivers on the desk instead of under it (where my comp sits) and it seemed to have helped some. The winner is still clear though.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Winner:&lt;/b&gt; Plantronics. Hands down.

&lt;h2&gt;Sound quality&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This may annoy some: There is always some static in the background. It is very quiet, and if you play any sound, you won't hear it. It's about the same for both units, and much lower than the background noise of my wireless Sony MDR-RF800R headphones. But it is definitely there, and it won't go away.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Listening to music or playing games with the headsets works just fine. But that's about it - if you are an audiophile, don't even bother. For the rest of us, it could be useful to know that the Plantronics provide more bass and the treble suffers some (making the sound quite muffled), while the Creatives are just about the other way around, with a clear treble but less punch. For me, they both provide a pleasant listening experience. I can barely make out the background noise when playing music, even when listening to ambient (Brian Eno's Apollo sounds just as great).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Winner: &lt;/b&gt;Plantronics. Because I like bass. ;)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The microphone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The Plantronics use a boom mic, which looks much more solid than the flexible arm of the Creative. To activate any of the microphones, just pull it down.
&lt;/p&gt;
[image plantronics_mic]
[image creative_mic]
&lt;p&gt;
The sound is good in both cases. I tried Skyping a bit, and the other party felt an improvement in sound quality over my old (el cheapo) wired headset. Again, there is some background noise, but speech comes though clearly.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Winner: &lt;/b&gt;Tie. Unless you have a problem with Creative's flimsy design.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Buttons&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Both units give you a few buttons placed on the side to play with. With the Plantronics you get On/Off, Volume Up, Volume Down, Play/Pause, and Skip. Creative gives you On/Off, Volume Up, Volume Down, and Answer call (on Skype or such). Not much to say here, for me the buttons a mostly redundant, save for On/Off and Volume. I can't find a way to reprogram the other buttons either. But on the other hand, it just just feel gimmicky and who cares.
&lt;/p&gt;
[image plantronics_buttons]
[image creative_buttons]
&lt;p&gt;
Fore some reason, Plantronics placed the buttons on the left side while Creative decided to go for the right side.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Update:&lt;/b&gt; To turn off the Plantronics, press and hold the on/off button for about a second. If you hold it too long (2 seconds or so) they will not switch off, instead the LED will start blinking blue.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Winner:&lt;/b&gt; Actually I don't really feel that this is so important.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The Creatives are a bit more expensive, but it basically just comes down to what you need from your headset. So here the summary:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Get the Creative HS-1200 if you:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Want to be able to use and recharge the unit at the same time (less risk of running out of battery)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prefer a clear treble over bass&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Like the idea of a pickup button&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prefer smaller cups&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;... or maybe you just like the design.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get the Plantronics .Audio 995 if you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prefer a smaller receiver&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Like a bit more bass&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wants some music controls: Play/Pause and Skip&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prefer cups that, while not oversized, are at least not way too undersized&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Need a bit more range.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Want to save some $$$&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;... or maybe you just like the design.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I prefer the Plantronics but that's just me.&lt;/p&gt;

    <header>New lens - Tamron 18-270 3.5-6.3 DI II VC</header>
    <readableid>new_lens_-_tamron_18-270_3.5-6.3_di_ii_vc</readableid>
    <subheader>Good glass</subheader>
    <intro> [image front] Although the kit lens for the Canon 1000D (18-55 3.5-5.6 IS) does a pretty good job, it definitely has its limitations. After all, 55mm is not very long and you will finding yourself resorting to the good old foot zoom (aka running around). Since I was going on a trip to Egypt, I figured it was time to pick up something more powerful and flexible for my holiday memories. Since changing lenses can be a hassle, I decided to go for the Tamron 18-270 VC, which covers everything from wide angle to long tele in a single lens.</intro>
    <content>&lt;h2&gt;Using the lens&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a zoom range of 18-270mm (about 28-430mm on a crop body, like the Canon 1000D) this lens is extremely flexible. It should be wide enough to eliminate the need to carry around extra wide-angle lenses, and long enough to make tele lenses mostly redundant.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The Tamron weighs in at around 580 grams, which is almost three times as heavy as the kit lens. In my case, the extra weight is very noticeable - since the camera is about 500 grams, the total weight of camera and lens went up around 50% when using the Tamron instead of the kit lens.
&lt;/p&gt;
[image comparison1]
[image comparison2]
&lt;p&gt;The lens has a switch which locks it at 18mm. This is really needed, as walking around with the lens pointing down could make it extend by its own weight and possibly cause trouble. The opposite is also true - I found it difficult to zoom in while pointing the lens upwards. And when letting go of it (unless it is really extended all the way to 270mm), it falls back to 18mm by itself. So using this lens on a tripod, shooting upwards at 100mm or so is simply impossible. Maybe duct tape could hold it in place?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below are two pictures showing the difference at 18 to 270mm.&lt;/p&gt;
[image 18mm]
[image 270mm]
&lt;h2&gt;Vibration correction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Tamron calls its optical image stabilizer "Vibration Correction", or VC for short. When pressing the shutter halfway, the system kicks in and you can immediately see in the optical viewfinder how the picture just sort of freezes as small vibrations are eliminated. The system works about as well as Canon's IS, which you can read about in an &lt;a href="/article/canon_image_stabilizer_is_test"&gt;older post&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
[image vc]
[image novc]
&lt;h2&gt;Sharpness&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subjectively, the Tamron is about as sharp as the kit lens - which means that most pictures come out a bit soft. The Tamron has worse focusing issues at times though, when the lens reports to have focused but the pictures come out all blurry. This is one of the biggest problems with this lens so far. Refocusing and taking another picture usually solves it though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chromatic aberration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Tamron has it. Purple or green colors along edges are common, but also expected with this kind of lens. The picture below shows an example where the effects are particularly noticeable.&lt;/p&gt;
[image aberration]
&lt;h2&gt;Sample pictures&lt;/h2&gt;
[image sunrise]
[image moon]
[image squirrel]
[image macro]
&lt;p&gt;
For more sample pictures, check the &lt;a href="/images/28"&gt;image gallery from my trip to Egypt.&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The image quality is on par with the kit lens, which should be fine for most people. While there is some softness and chromatic aberration, the lens makes up for it in flexibility. Sure, a quality 300mm prime would beat the Tamron at the long end, but the possibility to go from long tele to wide angle in just a second matters more to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pros&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extreme zoom range (15x)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;VC works well (and is more or less a requirement at 270mm)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The lens actually comes with a hood included&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focusing does not rotate the front of the lens (not important for me, but more so for people using filters)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cons&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Much heavier than the kit lens&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unable to focus at times&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Macro is no improvement over the kit lens&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slight softness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some chromatic aberration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are looking for a very flexible walkabout lens and can compromise some on image quality, look no further. But if you need good macro as well, or something light... you will have to keep looking.&lt;/p&gt;

    <intro> [image the_coon]I really enjoyed the South Park episode that aired last week, mostly thanks to the references to Miyazaki's 1988 film "My Neighbour Totoro". In case you missed it, here is a &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkr3QpiKF-E"&gt;"comparison"&lt;/a&gt;. Also, make sure to check out the &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HSD4jS9Kx4"&gt;Cthulhu song&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo9dol1NDiQ"&gt;Japanese original&lt;/a&gt;).</intro>

    <intro> [image shiny_icon] I was playing around a bit with &lt;a href="http://raphaeljs.com/"&gt;Rapha√´l&lt;/a&gt; today and I was quite impressed. Rapha√´l is a Javascript library which makes creation of vector graphics on the web really easy. I used some symbols freely available from their website and created a simple script that adds a shiny background to them (one example is seen on the left).
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

    <subheader>From the About Time-dept.</subheader>
    <intro>I recently upgraded the operating system of my SonyEricsson X10 Mini Pro from Android 1.6 to 2.1. Some minor (read: unnecessary) changes were immediately noticeable, like the "slide to unlock" or the darker background. So first impression: Yay. But after some time with it, I was happy to discover that the update solved a problem that has been bugging me for some time: Since Microsoft gave Hotmail that last major makeover, it has left me with nothing but a white page after logon. But now it works again! So that problem is definitely solved, and I guess it also means the system carries a more compatible browser. Thumbs up. :)</intro>

    <header>Soundcard - Asus Xonar DX</header>
    <readableid>soundcard_-_asus_xonar_dx</readableid>
    <subheader>Discrete is better?</subheader>
    <intro> [image the_box] I have been using integrated sound for several years now, and I have been mostly satisfied with it. But the weaknesses of the Realtek ALC883 clearly show once you crank up the volume - it's not just loud static, you can actually hear the hard drive and CPU (?) working, through the speakers! The signal must be badly isolated or something. I figured a discrete solution would not suffer from the same problems, and turned to the Asus Xonar DX. Read on for a short review.</intro>
    <content>&lt;h2&gt;In the Box&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The card was reasonably priced at around 55 EUR, so I decided to go for it. Opening up the box, I found an RCA cable inside, a Toslink optical adapter and a low profile bracket, plus a driver CD. As expected, the drivers were outdated and the other software on the CD basically useless. Just get the drivers directly from Asus web page. I first installed the drivers on the CD, then just upgraded to new drivers, which made the Asus Xonar Audio Center (where you make all settings for the card) to break. A quick search on the Asus forums revealed I was not the only one. Uninstalling and reinstalling the drivers did the trick, but it wasn't pretty.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Power hungry?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
[image card_top] I was surprised to discover that the card required an external power connector. I can just about accept that my graphics cards needs one, but a sound card? Without one, the card will apparently not work.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You can connect front panel connectors (microphone and front-out) to the card, which is actually quite useful. I don't have one though, would have been nice by Asus to at least provide a rear bracket with connectors.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why so few connectors?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
[image the_card] Looking at the front, you may notice that there seems to be a few ports missing. From the right, we have: rear surround, center/sub, side surround, headphone/front, and the leftmost: mic/line-in/optical S/PDIF. That's right - the card combines microphone, line-in and S/PDIF into one port. Which is terrible. I used to have a microphone for Skype connected to the mic jack, and the karaoke equipment connected to the line-in. This worked just fine on the ALC883, but now it's a no-go. A way to work around it is to hook up one mic to the front panel mic jack though (if your case has one - mine does not).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Since the card only outputs front sound to one port, having headphones and speakers connected at the same time is a hassle. Either 1) Get a splitter plug and connect both to the same port, or 2) Connect the headphones to the front panel - you will have to switch between front and back through software manually to get this to work though, since the card can only output sound to one port at a time.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
And did I mention that the card does not support coaxial S/PDIF, which my ALC883 does?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
By the way, many sound cards (the super cheap ALC883 comes to mind) can output sound to more than one port, or turn an output port into line-in. Just connect something to any port, and the software will ask what you would like to do. For example, you can use the rear speakers port as a line-in. Does the Xonar DX do this? No.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Karaoke&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The card has a few controls for karaoke, and can add some reverb similar like what professional eqipment does. I gave it a go and first my impression was... that it wasn't very impressive. The card had some serious microphone input lag (half a second?) and ruined the experience completely. At this stage, I updated the drivers (which broke the Audio Center at first, as previously stated) which seemed to make things a bit better. I also noticed that the lag was less noticeable if you do not tick the "Listen to this device" checkbox in the Windows Recording Devices, but instead go to the "Custom" tab and tick "Monitoring" (can also be done using the Xonar Audio Center). The delay is now short enough to be acceptable, but the ALC883 is still faster. The reverb sounds good though and partially makes up for the shortcomings.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sound quality&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I was quite disappointed with the card so far, since it had increased my power draw, made my cable setup more complicated, and had not really improved karaoke. But here comes the good part (finally) - the background static is almost completely gone. No annoying sounds from other equipment leak through, the sound is clean and crisp.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Subjectively, mic recording quality also improved. About music listening, the sound quality is definitely good, but to be honest, I cannot really tell the difference between the DX and the ALC883.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There are many bad things I could say about this card, and only a few good. Luckily, getting rid of the static was important for me and the card pulled it off so I guess I'll stick to it. But recommend it? Not so sure about that.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Update: &lt;/b&gt;I returned the card for a refund.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pros&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No background noise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Karaoke reverb is fun&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cons&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Putting together Mic, Line-In and S/PDIF is just plain stupid&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No coaxial S/PDIF&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can only output front speakers to one port at a time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Microphone input lag almost kills karaoke&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is an external power source really necessary?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <readableid>fun_with_bokeh</readableid>
    <subheader>Because round lights are no fun</subheader>
    <intro> [image fortune_cat_with_stars] I got this cool tip from a friend: Custom bokeh! Basically, you take s small piece of cardbaord (or similar) and cut out a nicely shaped hole (for example, a star) in the middle. Place it in front of the camera lens, making sure light can enter through the hole only. Depending on the shape of the hole, you can get very interesting results - try it out on candles in a dark room, for example! The picture to the left shows my result after some experimentation. For a how-to, check out my friends &lt;a href="http://henrikpettersson.blogg.se/2011/january/bokeh.html"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; (swedish, but instructions in English).</intro>

    <header>Getting Started with Star Trails</header>
    <readableid>getting_started_with_star_trails</readableid>
    <subheader>Paint the sky</subheader>
    <intro> [image startrails] I just recently started experimenting with star trails photography. The "classic" technique is to make one single exposure (say, for one hour), and as the earth rotates, the stars will paint beautiful trails on the sensor/film. Now, this may not work for everyone. A one hour exposure would require the surrounding to be pitch black. I live in the city, and along with that comes a lot of light pollution. So instead of doing it the real way, I had to resort to some cheating. The idea is quite simple: Have the camera take a series of pictures of the clear night sky, then merge them in the computer. Read on for more.</intro>
    <content>&lt;h2&gt;What you need&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Now, I have only tried this with my DSLR, but I guess it would be possible using a compact as well. With a DSLR, you will typically need:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A tripod&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A remote shutter release (don't have one? There actually more useful than you might think.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A clear night sky and some patience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Setting it up&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I set the camera up on my balcony as a first test. This is the basic procedure:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set the lens focus to infinity. This may be a bit tricky, especially with lenses like the Canon kit lens, where nothing on the lens actually indicates distance. Try focusing on something far away, adjust manually if needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Switch off auto focus and optical image stabilizer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set the drive mode to "Continuous", making sure that a series of pictures will be taken.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Switch to manual mode. This may need some experimenting. I opened up the aperture fully, set ISO to 400 and shutter speed to 30 seconds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mount the camera on the tripod, use the shutter release to take a test shot. If the stars look clear and sharp, you are good to go.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lock the shutter release (making the camera shoot pictures continuously) and wait for an hour or so.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Ok, so you waited for one hour, and now you are back inside. Time to merge the images. I used &lt;a href="http://www.startrails.de/html/software.html" target="_blank"&gt;Star Trails&lt;/a&gt;, a very useful (and free) piece of software. Just add all the images and the application will merge them for you. The result is shown below.
&lt;/p&gt;

[image balcony]

&lt;p&gt;
Time to get to the countryside and take some real pictures! Now, while waiting out there, alone and in the dark, looking at the night sky, why not listen to some music? Minimalistic space ambient fits perfectly, so let me recommend &lt;a href="http://www.ambient-nights.org/music.php" target="_blank"&gt;The Sol System mixes from Alex Hephaestion&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

    <header>ASK 731SP 3G Smartpad Review</header>
    <readableid>ask_731sp_3g_smartpad_review</readableid>
    <subheader>Tablet El-Cheapo</subheader>
    <intro> [image the_device] Recently, the market has been flooded by a number of cheap Android tablets - most of them rather iPad lookalikes than iPad killers. I recently picked this one up in Hong Kong, where it sells for around 1700 HKD, which roughly equals 160 EUR. A quite reasonable price, considering that it features a 7 inch capacitive multi touch screen. So is the Smartpad the gem in the pile of chinese plastic junk, or is it rather the other way around? Let's find out.</intro>
    <content>&lt;h2&gt;The device&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Smartpad looks quite typical for a tablets; glossy front with nothing on it, a metal frame, and a white plastic back.&lt;/p&gt;

[image buttons]

&lt;p&gt;
In the side of the tablet, there is a regular USB port. According to the product sheet, a 3G modem can be connected to this port, thus the inclusion of 3G in the name (just to make this clear: the device itself lacks any 3G capabilities). The USB port can also be used for USB sticks, a keyboard or a mouse. By using a USB hub, several devices can be connected - both a keyboard and a mouse, for instance. Using Android with a mouse feels a bit odd though.
&lt;/p&gt;

[image case]

&lt;p&gt;
The included case, which contains a keyboard, transforms the device into something that resembles a flimsy netbook. Thumbs up.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Using it&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
As we start navigating around the menus, we do notice that things are a bit sluggish. Everything works, but it definitely lacks the smoothness and snappiness of the iPad. This is much because of built in low-cost CPU, a Rockchip RK2818, running at 660 MHz. The display feels good though and can tell tapping from flipping quite accurately.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
When using the browser, web pages show up as expected. Scrolling and pinch-zooming both work, although a bit slow - especially as the page is still loading. In general, this pretty much sums it up - web pages work, but it feels a bit slow and and will require some patience. Note, also, that since we are running Android 2.1, flash does not work out of the box.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I cannot say much about video playback. It just works with no problem, and watching movies on the 7'' display is very comfortable.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I was surprised to see that the battery life was quite acceptable. Watching a full length movie eats up about 30% of the battery, which means that watching two and probably even three two-hour movies should be possible.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Apps&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Downloading and installing apps from the Android Market usually works without a hitch, but there are a few problems. Here is a dealbreaker for many: Angry Birds does not work. It just doesn't start. Moreover, I am unable to sign in to Skype, it just says "Signing in..." forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So do I recommend it? Well - it wasn't terribly expensive and it does most of the things I expect of it. For watching videos, reading e-books and doing some web browsing, the Smartpad does well. I am missing a few things however - a webcam, Android 2.2 preloaded and a faster CPU would have been great. Angry Birds would have been a plus as well. But for me, this is a good start.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now, I happened to notice that there is an A-Pad (MT2818) with the exact same specifications as the Smartpad, but with HDMI out added, selling for about 10% less. Something to consider first.
&lt;/p&gt;

    <subheader>Flopped and Chopped, Flipped and Clipped</subheader>
    <intro> [image bullhead_handlebars] I have an old bike with drop handlebars. Riding it is a lot of fun, but with the hands placed on the brake hoods - which I find is the most comfortable way to ride - I am unable to use the brakes efficiently. The pursuit handlebar, or bullhorn, looked both functional and cool so I decided to try to convert the handlebar into one. It proved quite easy; I removed the brakes, turned the handlebar around, cut the drops and reinstalled the brakes upside down. The result was very comfortable and feels a lot safer. After the mod, I did some googling and found &lt;a href="http://www.ridefixedgear.com/howto/convert-drop-handlebars-bullhorns" target="_blank"&gt;this guide on Ride Fixed Gear&lt;/a&gt; which demonstrates the steps. Apparently, it's called "chop-and-flop" and it seems that I got it right. ;)</intro>

    <header>Fake Raindrops Macro Photography</header>
    <readableid>fake_raindrops_macro_photography</readableid>
    <subheader>Bring your own rain</subheader>
    <intro> [image grass] I became an instant fan of Bryan Peterson after reading his book "Understanding Exposure", which taught me a lot about being creative with a camera. Recently, I saw &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23nNTwmEBUk" target="_blank"&gt;one of his videos online&lt;/a&gt; on shooting straws of grass with drops of water on them, and I just needed to give it a shot myself. Nice results without much effort, I have to say - you can shoot this in your backyard.</intro>
    <content>&lt;h2&gt;About Macro Photography&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Macro photography is fun. I'm always surprised of the small details that are hardly visible to the naked eye, that become apparent in the shots. Many everyday things just look amazing shot in macro.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
One problem with shooting macro, however, is that that kit lens you got with your DSLR just can't get very close. So, how do we solve this? Fear not - there are several ways, even on a tight budget. Here are a few options:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
Get a macro lens. I don't know much about them since I don't have one myself, but I bet they are great for macro since they got it in the name and all. They don't come for free though.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
Turn the kit lens around. This novel trick will actually turn a regular lens into a macro lens. I have tried it by just holding the lens in front of the camera, and it works. There should be ways to properly attach it to the camera. Google it before resorting to duct tape.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
Extension tubes. These sit between the camera and the lens and allows the lens to focus closer. They are quite cheap and many of them allow the camera to communicate with the lens.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I use the last option. My extension tubes have M42 mounts and cannot send signals to the lens, which is an old Pentax 55mm 1.8 and doesn't have any electronics anyway. With an adapter, I find it to be a cheap and well working solution with my Canon 1000D.
&lt;/p&gt;

[image macro_lens]

&lt;h2&gt;Start Shooting&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The idea here is to shoot single straws of grass with raindrops on them, in full sunlight. But how often do we have that? Instead of waiting for rain, which is a total waste of time, just carry it with you! Get out there and bring a spray bottle with water along. Find a nice patch of grass (actually, only a single straw should do it) and apply until rainy-looking. To make things even more interesting, place a colorful object, a flower for example, behind the grass you are shooting as a background. As we all know, the only way to take interesting pictures is by shooting from awkard positions, so get down on the ground, find a nice straw and shoot away.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Interestingly, the background will often show up inside the drops, upside-down - which allows for even more creativity.
&lt;/p&gt;
[image closeup]

&lt;p&gt;Here is another one, soft this time:&lt;/p&gt;

[image grass_soft]

&lt;p&gt;
Of course, this is not limited to grass.
&lt;/p&gt;

[image dandelion]

[image tulip]

&lt;h2&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I noticed that my pictures looked a bit dull in color. If you have the same problem, try adjusting the color profile when sa bit to make the colors more saturated, adding that extra punch. Or try some slight adjustments with Photoshop or Gimp.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Make sure to check out more of Bryan Peterson's videos, and keep shooting!

    <intro> [image icon] Finally saw the Social Network yesterday. It has been called best movie of the year by some reviewers, so my expectations were high. While good, I was slightly disappointed. To me, Zuckerberg just didn't seem to be a very likeable guy.

It's funny actually - after seeing Fast and Furious, I felt like speeding, after the Social Network, I felt like coding. So this site now has the infamous "Like"-button - just click Comment/Share below.</intro>

    <header>Vignetting with the Gimp</header>
    <readableid>vignetting_with_the_gimp</readableid>
    <subheader>Defective by design</subheader>
    <intro> [image vignette1] Dark corners in a photo are usually referred to as vignetting. Actually a lens defect, it does leave a lot of room for creativity. Portrait shots, for example, can benefit from some vignetting since the dark corners emphasize the subject in the middle. It also adds a nice vintage effect and often works well on black and white photos.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Adobe Lightroom, there is built-in functionality for adding vignette. But what about Gimp? Turns out there are several ways to do it. Read on.</intro>
    <content>&lt;h2&gt;Subtlety is key&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When creating a vignetting effect, adding too much happens easily. In this tutorial, I exaggerate the effect some (actually, quite a lot), to make the different results of the methods more clear. A good vignette should just barely be visible.&lt;/p&gt;

[image original]

&lt;h2&gt;Method 1: Interesting but fake&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the simplest way and produces interesting results. The basic idea is to create a new layer on top of the image containing a radial fill, and overlaying the layer on the image. These are the steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the toolbox, set the foreground color to white and the background color to black.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From the Layers dialog, add a new layer (Ctrl+Shift+N). (Fill type doesn't matter.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the layers dialog, set the Mode to Overlay.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click the Blend (Gradient) Tool in the Toolbox.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the tool options dialog, set the shape to radial.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make a gradient by clicking and dragging from the middle of the image to any of the corners.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adjust the layer opacity as needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

[image vignette1]

&lt;p&gt;Tip #1: If you want to create an even stronger effect, just duplicate the new layer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tip #2: In the tool options, select a gradient that goes from transparent to black instead of white to transparent (with some offset, as described below) to avoid brightening the center.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Method 2: More natural&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, a copy of the image is created and put on top. It's center is removed using a layer mask and the corners are darkened using the Levels tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the toolbox, set the foreground color to black and the background color to white (ie opposite to method 1).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using the layer dialog, select the background and duplicate it (Ctrl+Shift+D).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Right-click the new layer and select Add Layer Mask (fill color doesn't matter).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click the Blend (Gradient) Tool in the Toolbox.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the tool options dialog, set the shape to radial.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still in the tool options dialog, increase the Offset some. (I set it to around 30.) This will prevent the gradient from fading from the start.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure the layer mask is selected, and drag the gradient from the center to any of the corners.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the layers dialog, right click the layer and deselect Edit Layer Mask.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Under the Colors menu (main image window), select Levels. Drag the left triangle (arrow) closer to the center to darken the corners.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
[image vignette2]

&lt;p&gt;Tip: Experiment with tools other than the Levels dialog to darken the image for a different effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Method 3: More control (maybe)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By adding a layer and applying a blurred layer mask, we create a dark, round, fuzzy black border which is put on top of the original image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the toolbox, set the foreground color to black and the background color to white.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From the Layers dialog, add a new layer (Ctrl+Shift+N). Set Fill Type to foreground color.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set the Mode to Overlay.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Right-click the new layer and select Add Layer Mask.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Initialize the Layer Mask to White (full opacity).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With the layer mask selected, use the Ellipse select tool to select the "interesting" part of the image - ie the part that will remain unaffected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the Bucket fill tool to fill the selection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press Shift+Ctrl+A to get rid of the selection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to Filters -&gt; Blur -&gt; Gaussian Blur. Set radius (both x and y) to a high value (I used around 500 pixels for a 2592x3888 pixels image, should give you a rough idea) and click Ok.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adjust the layer opacity as needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
[image vignette3]

&lt;p&gt;Tip: By using the Free select tool instead of the Ellipse select tool, you can customize the shape of the vignette.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Winner?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Method 2 is quite straightforward and produces good results. Method 1 creates a "cheap lens" effect (much thanks to the increase in brightness in the center), which could look cool applied to some shots, while it could completely ruin others. As for method 3, it feels a bit cumbersome, and adding that Gaussian blur is also slow. YMMV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And again it has been proven that everything can be done with Gimp. ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, the methods above could also be used to do away with vignetting by brightening the corners instead of darkening them (for example, by just inverting the layer mask used in method 3).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, hope this helps someone. Happy Gimping!&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <subheader>Is it 2003 already?</subheader>
    <intro> [image iecanvas] With IE9, the HTML5 canvas element suddenly went mainstream. Since I have an educated audience that makes sure to keep their web browsers updated, I made some changes to the &lt;a href="/iconmaker"&gt;Shiny Icon Maker&lt;/a&gt; to take advantage of some features of the canvas. For example, PNG conversion can now be done client-side, which is faster and more accurate. &lt;a href="/iconmaker"&gt;Give it a try.&lt;/a&gt;</intro>

    <header>DIY DSLR Camera Sling Strap</header>
    <readableid>diy_dslr_camera_sling_strap</readableid>
    <subheader>Too much time, too little money</subheader>
    <intro> [image done] The strap that came with your camera is quite useful. Not only does it remind you of what brand you have (in case you forgot), but it is also able to help avoiding fatal damages to the camera. However, the strap often gets stuck or tangled up when you need to move the camera in position, which could kill the shot completely.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, wouldn't it be so much better if the strap could just stay in place, and the camera would just move along it instead? These do exist, but I decided to give it a try myself before shelling out some EUR 50 for such a simple thing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read on for a tutorial on how to make your own sling strap.</intro>
    <content>&lt;h2&gt;What you need&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A strap (e.g. from some old bag) with "dog hooks"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A tripod quick release&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some fabric (a carrying pouch for example)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and if you try this on your own, you do it at your own risk. So don't blame me when the strap snaps and that Canon 5D with L-glass falls to its death. ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Step 1: Find a strap&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strap I used had metal hooks on each end. The hooks seem quite strong and should easily be able to carry the weight of the camera.&lt;/p&gt;

[image bag]

[image dog_hooks]

&lt;h2&gt;Step 2: Adjust the length&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This type of trap usually has one hook fixed to the end, while the other can slide along it. This is necessary in order to be able to adjust the length of the strap. Now, adjust the strap to be as short as possible. What you will end up with is a loop, which is exactly what we need.&lt;/p&gt;

[image strap_loop]

&lt;h2&gt;Step 3: Attach the hook to the quick release&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This may be a bit tricky. I was lucky enough to have hooks with just the right size to fit into the quick release. I guess you could attach a keyring or so between the hook and the quick release if the hooks are too big.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don't have a quick release, try to find something "suitable" with a 1/4" screw at your local hardware store.&lt;/p&gt;

[image quick_release]

&lt;h2&gt;Step 4: Cover the second hook with some fabric&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is optional, but we still have the second hook on the strap, doing nothing. You could remove it, but I wanted to keep the strap intact. Therefore, I covered the hook with a carrying pouch from a portable scanner. Doubles as a shoulder pad. Just imagine what you can achieve with some double adhesive tape!&lt;/p&gt;

[image done]

&lt;h2&gt;Step 5: Try it out!&lt;/h2&gt;

[image hip]

[image in_position]

&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that's basically your zero-cost camera sling. I need to try it out some more before I use it with a heavier lens (and maybe an external flash), but so far it works really well with the Canon 1000D and a 50mm 1.8.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <header>Simple Photo Studio at Home</header>
    <readableid>simple_photo_studio_at_home</readableid>
    <subheader>More DIY</subheader>
    <intro> [image done] Taking pictures of products, isolated on white background is something I do a lot, which you may have noticed from this blog. Achieving good (or, at least decent) results is actually much easier than you might think, and costs basically nothing. No special studio lighting or reflectors are required, and the setup is simple. Read on for how to set up your own little photo studio at home for product photography.</intro>
    <content>&lt;h2&gt;Step 1: Get a white background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Okay, you might fancy some other color but I like plain white. As a background, I use the back of a regular poster. The bigger, the better.
&lt;/p&gt;
[image poster]
&lt;h2&gt;Step 2: Find a location and set it up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We need soft, even light for this shot. Shooting outside in the shade works, and so does shooting indoors using a window with indirect light. Direct sunlight will cause harsh shadows, and unless that's what you're going for, should be avoided.
&lt;/p&gt;
[image setup]
&lt;h2&gt;Step 3: Place the product to shoot on the poster&lt;/h2&gt;
[image product]
&lt;h2&gt;Step 4: Start shooting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
With the product placed on the ground, you need to get down there too. A few things to think about:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;White balance:&lt;/b&gt; To get the white balance right, take a shot of the empty white poster and set as custom white balance (refer to Google on how to do this on your camera).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Exposure: &lt;/b&gt;The white background often turns out grey-ish. To avoid this, experiment with the exposure compensation setting. +1 EV is often good.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Focal length:&lt;/b&gt; You are probably close to what you are shooting, but try to move away a bit. I usually keep the focal length around 50mm or so. Shooting close at wide angle will distort the product (it does look cool in some cases though).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Aperture:&lt;/b&gt; Typically, you want to have the whole product in focus, so close the aperture a bit. Try f/8 or f/11 and take it from there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;ISO:&lt;/b&gt; Keep that ISO down - if you can keep it as low as 100 - great, higher than 400 is typically bad.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Shutter speed:&lt;/b&gt; Keep it low, ideal is 1/60th of a second or faster, but 1/30th and a steady hand or 1/15th and image stabilizer is still ok. You may also consider using a (possibly improvised) tripod or experimenting with ISO and/or aperture.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Clean!&lt;/b&gt; Dust is everywhere, and glass (if that's what you're shooting) just loves fingerprints. It may look great in the camera, but you will notice it later in the computer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
[image done]
&lt;h2&gt;Optional: Editing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If the background didn't turn out white enough, or if the blacks are not deep enough, we can easily fix that using Photoshop or Gimp. I usually use the levels tool in Gimp (Colors -&gt; Levels).
&lt;/p&gt;

[image levels]
[image white]
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It's not perfect, but it's simple and it works for simple shots. The biggest problem is probably the background. In a studio, you would usually illuminate the background enough to be completely blown out, but we need to overexpose and cheat by using Gimp instead. Maybe I will have a look at some DIY studio lighting further on to try and solve that, or to get some more dramatic lighting.

    <header>Velbon Sherpa 200R Review</header>
    <readableid>velbon_sherpa_200r_review</readableid>
    <subheader>Tripods: Like monopods, but triple the fun</subheader>
    <intro> [image tripod] Shooting under low-light conditions is hard. I have mentioned &lt;a href="/article/canon_image_stabilizer_is_test"&gt;optical stabilizing&lt;/a&gt; earlier, which helps prevent camera shake down to 1/10th or so. But after that, you will have to resort to what photographers have done for years - using a tripod. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I got the Velbon Sherpa 200R a while ago and I thought I could share my thoughts on it. This review may not be very in-depth - all I can really compare it to is my old tripod which was mostly plastic. This is definitely better - although heavier - stuff. Read on for more.</intro>
    <content>&lt;h2&gt;In the box&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I opened the box, I found... well, the tripod. Nothing else, except some cardboard.&lt;/p&gt;

[image simple]

&lt;h2&gt;Basic specs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Head type: &lt;/b&gt; Pan head (PH-157Q)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Max height: &lt;/b&gt;167.5 cm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lowest height: &lt;/b&gt;59 cm (or 0 cm with center column upside down)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Weight: &lt;/b&gt;2 kg&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Disassembly&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The tripod can be disassembled into four parts; the quick release, the head, the center column, and the legs. Separating the middle column from the legs (or removing the head) makes the tripod some 10 cm (4 inches) shorter which could be useful when travelling.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the head can be removed, it should be possible to replace it with some other type. The center column has a standard 3/8-16 screw on top.&lt;/p&gt;

[image disassembled]

&lt;h2&gt;Using it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a no-frills tripod, everything works as expected. Just mount the camera to the quick release and attach it to the head, where it snaps firmly into place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Sherpa 200R comes with a PH-157Q panhead. It feels both smooth and stable. However, it cannot be locked into a "horizontal-only mode". With my old tripod, turning the handle would only allow horizontal panning, and there was an extra knob for vertical panning. But that was mostly annoying, I like the Sherpa better where just using the handle allows both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The head can also be flipped on the side to allow vertical shots. My old tripod had serious creep problems (camera slowly turning downwards) when used this way. With the 200R, I have no such issues, even with the Tamron 18-270 (which I consider to be quite heavy for a consumer lens).&lt;/p&gt;

[image head]

&lt;p&gt;Something I really liked about the 200R is that you can turn the center column around, which enables you to mount the camera upside down and shoot very close to the ground. (It actually reaches all the way down.) Of course, this makes operating the camera a bit more tricky as well, but it works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using it the "regular" way, it goes down to 59cm (about 2 feet). On more expensive models, the column can be split in two and the legs spread further apart, going down to about half of that.&lt;/p&gt;

[image upsidedown]

&lt;p&gt;The legs have three sections. Fully extended (including center column) it reaches up to 167.5 cm (roughly 5.5 feet). This is plenty enough for me, and at this height, it still feels very stable.&lt;/p&gt;

[image foot]

&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Pros&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sturdy, stable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Center column can be flipped&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good value (around 60 EUR)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Cons&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No bubble level&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flipping the head for vertical shots inconvenient, ball head would probably have been better&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A bit big and heavy (personal preference I guess)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What makes a good tripod? I guess it depends on your needs. If you are just starting out, or you want to replace that cheap plastic-only head tripod of yours, the Velbon Sherpa 200R is a stable, versatile and cheap solution. Recommended.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <header>Trying out Infrared Photography</header>
    <readableid>trying_out_infrared_photography</readableid>
    <subheader>Visible light is so last year</subheader>
    <intro> [image ir_water_processed] I was lucky enough to get an infrared (IR) filter from a friend a few weeks ago. An infrared filter will block visible light and just let through infrared light, which is invisible to the naked eye. The sensor in the camera can pick it up, however, and produce quite interesting results. After a few attempts, it was clear that shooting infrared takes some time getting used to, but it is also fun and rewarding. Continue reading for an IR crash course.</intro>
    <content>&lt;h2&gt;How does it work?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Infrared is not necessarily something you would shoot every day or in any situation. It's more of a cool thing that works well only under specific scenarios. The typical IR shot contains a lot of foliage against the sky on a sunny day. This may sound super boring, but with IR, everything changes: The leaves turn white and the sky turns black.
&lt;/p&gt;

[image small_tree]

&lt;h2&gt;Compatibility&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Some lenses tend to produce hot spots (a bright spot in the middle of the image). And I don't know about cameras. Make sure your equipment is compatible first. Google is your friend.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Getting to work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
First, wait for a sunny day. You need light, and a lot of it. Then go find some foliage. Foliage reflects a lot of light and looks cool in IR so try that first.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Second, get the camera set up properly. Here some camera settings to keep in mind (YMMV):
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;White balance: &lt;/b&gt;I did this by putting on the filter and shooting some grass, and using the resulting image as custom WB. Without it, the images will typically turn out purple.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Shutter speed: 30 seconds. &lt;/b&gt;The light metering will not work properly and we need a long exposure time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Aperture: f/11. &lt;/b&gt;IR makes the images unsharp for some reason, a smaller aperture helps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;ISO: 400. &lt;/b&gt;My camera is a bit noisy at 800 so I prefer to keep it lower.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Manual focus. &lt;/b&gt;Focusing will not work, so just do it manually.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you got that out of the way, set up the camera on a tripod. Compose, put on the filter and shoot. You will notice that you cannot see a thing with the filter on - so composing first is essential!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Example shots&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I shot these with a vintage 28mm at f/11.&lt;/p&gt;

[image bird]

[image ir_bird]

[image tree]

[image ir_tree]

&lt;h2&gt;Post-processing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With IR, there are many ways to give the image that extra punch using Photoshop or Gimp. A very simple way is by using the levels tool.&lt;/p&gt;
[image water]
[image ir_water]
[image levels]
[image ir_water_processed]

&lt;h2&gt;Closing thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to normal photography, shooting using an infrared filter is really a completely different beast. And I am definitely still learning. Next thing I might have a look at is to remove the hot pixels that become visible under long exposure. They are quite visible against the (typically) black sky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy shooting!&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <subheader>Plastic but not fantastic</subheader>
    <intro> [image nifty] Earlier this week, I accidentally dropped my Canon nifty-fifty lens on the floor. Without inspecting it, I put it on the camera and was happy to see that it worked. And today I tried to take it off - only to find that it was stuck. Turns out that this is a quite common problem with this lens - the lens mount is made out of plastic and easily gets damaged, which can lead to this problem. However, since the mount of the camera is metal (update: actually it's plastic as well), you still have a fair shot if you turn the lens hard enough. After a long struggle, the lens finally came off, together with some small loose plastic pieces. Luckily, both the camera and the lens survived. Don't try this at home!</intro>

To fix this, I created a small program. Just select the folder containing some JPEGs, and it will run through the images inside and rotate them when needed.

    <intro> [image chaos] This week's Photo Sunday theme was "Chaos", which made me think of the great game Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory. Green LED light, a window, some water and a flashlight and it looks just like Sam Fisher paid me a visit.

    <subheader>Why 2D is more fun than 3D</subheader>
    <intro> [image illusion] This week's theme being "Illusion", I decided to retry something I did a few years ago - building an impossible 3D triangle. I found instructions &lt;a href="http://www.coolopticalillusions.com/illusions/coolprinttriangle.pdf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and got busy. Once done, the thing looked nothing like a triangle; the trick is to look at it from just the right angle, preferably with one eye. The camera makes it almost look real.</intro>

    <intro>[image farewell] Been taking a break from participating lately, but decided to give it a go this weekend. I was out walking when I saw this Korean Air Airbus A380 shortly after takeoff. With &lt;a href="/article/new_lens_-_tamron_18-270_3.5-6.3_di_ii_vc"&gt;my Tamron&lt;/a&gt; at 270mm, it filled up the frame nicely.

    <readableid>photo_gift_tips_3_items_for_100_eur_each</readableid>
    <subheader>Coincidentally, they are about 100 USD each as well</subheader>
    <intro>[image 3in1] With christmas coming up, you might be looking for a gift for that hooked-on-photography brother of yours, or maybe you just want to treat yourself to something. Either way, if you are looking for photo related stuff but don't want want to break the bank (too much), let me suggest three items that might interest you.</intro>
    <content>&lt;h2&gt;1. Lowepro SlingShot 202 AW&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are all interested in camera bags, for that is where the camera and its lens are going to spend the rest of their lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SlingShot is a... well, slingshot model, meaning it's built like a backpack with only one strap. This enables you to wear the bag on the back, but still be able to quickly access its contents by simply sliding it around your shoulder.&lt;/p&gt;

[image lowepro]

&lt;p&gt;A few highlights that make this bag stand out:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A monopod or small tripod can be strapped to the side of the bag&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It has a built-in lens cleaning cloth which doubles as a gray card&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It features a built-in rain cover (which also looks like it could be sort of used as a gray card)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

[image lowepro_inside]


&lt;p&gt;You may not be able to fit all your equipment in this bag, but on a day tour, that would probably be too much anyway. Small and convenient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;2. Nissin SpeedLite Di622&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This external flash sort of plays in the same league as the Canon 430EX-ish and is a good and affordable start for anyone tired of that pop-up flash. Also available for Nikon! It might be a little more than 100 though, but it's a nice unit so what the heck.&lt;/p&gt;

[image speedlite]

&lt;p&gt;Some feature highlights:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A tilty-swively head which allows for bouncing the flash off the ceiling both when shooting vertically and horizontally&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Diffuser and flash-card built in, making the light softer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optical trigger - place the flash on a table next to your subject (stand included) and have the pop-up flash trigger it remotely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Subjectively, the flash is also crazy strong :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Mark II version is also available - costing a little more, but fixing adds some nice features, like remote radio triggering. Worth it IMO - off-camera flash opens up a world of possibilities. Mark II also has a Sony fit flavor. Yummy.&lt;/p&gt;

[image flash]

&lt;p&gt;I often feel that carrying this thing around everywhere is a bit too much, but it makes up for it once you see the results. Not as fancy as some more expensive Canon models, but a great and flexible start that gives some serious bang for the buck. Just get some quality rechargeable AAs as well!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Super-pro tip: Off-camera triggering is cool and all, but since the built-in flash must be used, it tends to make the image look flat and less dramatic. Use the flash exposure compensation to weaken the built-in flash and make the effect of the external flash stand out more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;3. Canon 50mm f/1.8 "Nifty Fifty"&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A must-have. Considering that a good lens often will run you, like, 400 EUR or more, the price tag of around 100 EUR for this little gem seems like a steal.&lt;/p&gt;

[image nifty_fifty]

&lt;p&gt;Highlights:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;50mm on a crop body makes this a perfect lens for portrait shots&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Very light - thanks, of course, to the the weak, plastic build quality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That 1.8 aperture is sure to deliver some bokeh-licious action!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And of course, it's fast too&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Might feel like a toy, but it produces some quality results. The lack of an optical stabilizer is made up for - in part - by the fact that it's very fast with the aperture fully open.&lt;/p&gt;

[image bokeh]

&lt;p&gt;And there is also a Nikkor 50mm f/1.8 for you Nikon fanboys too!&lt;/p&gt;

    <subheader>Noir is the new black</subheader>
    <intro>[image film_noir] Theme of last week was "Film noir", which got me really excited. High contrast black and white basically makes everything look cool and stylish so nothing can go wrong. A hat-owning friend of mine was helpful enough to model for me, so we went to a dark back alley at the evening to get some shots. The large shadow was created by placing my external flash - a Nissin Di622 - on the ground a few meters away from the subject and firing it remotely.</intro>

    <intro>[image bang] I've thinking about doing this for some time, and this week I finally had an excuse for it. I filled the balloon with water and placed it on a black blanket in a water-tolerant place. With the camera on a tripod and using an external flash, I set the shutter speed to 1/200th of a second. I then dropped the knife on the balloon and tried to capture the decisive moment. It took a few tries to get it right. Using a small aperture like f/11 turned out to be important to get both the water and the knife in focus.</intro>

    <header>A few tricks with layer masks</header>
    <readableid>a_few_tricks_with_layer_masks</readableid>
    <subheader>Higher dynamic range than your eyes can handle</subheader>
    <intro>[image done] Theme of this week was "Lit", and my submission is shown to the left. I simply put the plastic penguin on top of the light bulb and shot it using fill flash. At first, I was not particularly satisfied with the results, but after some playing around with the colors in GIMP using layer masks, it looked much more appealing. Read on for some tips on how to use layer masks to make dark areas brighter, and bright areas darker - a sort of HDR, you could say.</intro>
    <content>&lt;h2&gt;Start super-short tutorial!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use GIMP for this, but the same principle can be used in most image editing programs, including Photoshop. I also use a JPEG. You can get better results using RAW format.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip: &lt;/strong&gt;Also check out my other, more detailed &lt;a href="/article/gimp_image_editing"&gt;tutorial on layer masks and the levels tool.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's start with the original image.&lt;/p&gt;

[image original]

&lt;p&gt;Duplicate the layer and work with the copy (right-click on layer, select Duplicate). By using the Levels tool, we can make the image darker and bring out some of the warmth from the light.&lt;/p&gt;

[image dark]

&lt;p&gt;Make another copy of the original layer and move it to the top. Use the Levels tool again, but make the image brighter instead, so that the penguin looks right.&lt;/p&gt;

[image light]

&lt;p&gt;To remedy this, add a layer mask to the top layer (ie. the penguin layer). When asked, select to create it with Full Transparency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After clicking ok, only the layer behind, with the dark penguin will be visible. But fear not! Paint with a white brush (a fuzzy, big one is usually good) and the brighter penguin shines through.&lt;/p&gt;

    <header>Do it Yourself - Flash Umbrella</header>
    <readableid>do_it_yourself_-_flash_umbrella</readableid>
    <subheader>Fun on rainy days</subheader>
    <intro>[image umbrella] Flash umbrellas are really cool. Except from making you look like a full-time pro, they spread and soften light, which makes them ideal for portrait photography. They are also very portable, just like regular umbrellas. But there is very little magic involved, and there are not too many differences between a flash umbrella and a regular one. So why not try to use your umbrella for something more interesting than rain?</intro>
    <content>&lt;h2&gt;What you need&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;A tripod.&lt;/b&gt; The taller, the better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;A flash gun that can be remotely triggered.&lt;/b&gt; If you don't have one, 1) Get one! or 2) Experiment with a strong light bulb instead. There are some crazy strong energy saving light bulbs for photography around.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;An umbrella.&lt;/b&gt; I use one with silver color on the inside, which is good for bouncing. You could also use a white one (either bounce or shoot-through), or just experiment with different colors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The super-simple setup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Get the tripod mount that hopefully came with your flash and mount the flash on the tripod. Then, attach the umbrella. You will have to improvise here. If you have a clamp that fits, try that. I used two strips of cable tie (the kind that can be opened by hand). If nothing else works, duct tape is your friend.
&lt;/p&gt;

[image ready]

&lt;p&gt;You could also mount the flash flat, which will make sure the light hits closer to the center of the umbrella and is more evenly spread.&lt;/p&gt;

[image alternative]

[image umbrella]

[image sample]

&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For a simple home studio, this is a simple way of getting slightly more interesting light. Its portability makes it a great companion for field trips, too! The ability to protect against rain is an added bonus.

    <header>Prevent JavaScript Redirect in Firefox</header>
    <readableid>prevent_javascript_redirect_in_firefox</readableid>
    <subheader>Hero Add-on of the day</subheader>
    <intro>[image requestpolicy] I recently set up a simple web page using the "click-and-play" CMS &lt;a href="http://www.jimdo.com" target="_blank"&gt;Jimdo&lt;/a&gt; recently, but realized today that the URL I chose for my site could have been better. I decided to set up another page with a new URL and redirect to it from the first site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As a first attempt, I tried a simple Javascript approach, using a random test URL which pointed to nothing:
&lt;code&gt;
&amp;amp;lt;script type="text/javascript"&amp;amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
document.location = "http://example.com";&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;amp;lt;/script&amp;amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
This worked. However, Jimdo is a quite WYSIWYG-oriented CMS, and needs to show the web page in order to edit it. Trying to edit the original page now sent me directly to the test URL instead! Disabling Javascript did not help either, since it broke the CMS interface. Nice catch-22. I was stuck with a broken page.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The solution: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.requestpolicy.com/" target="_blank"&gt;RequestPolicy&lt;/a&gt;! This Firefox plugin warns you when a site attempts a Javascript redirect and lets you prevent it from happening, without breaking any other Javascript code. After installation, I just opened the page, the redirect was prevented, and I could edit the page again - like correcting the URL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That said, a Javascript redirect is less than ideal. If you can, use a 301 redirect (Google it) whenever possible.</intro>

    <subheader>Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger</subheader>
    <intro>[image 600d] Just picked up a brand new DSLR a few days ago, the 600D. It looks very similar to the 1000D, but has a few nice tricks up its sleeve, like a flippy-tilty screen, faster ISO, and video recording in full HD. I'm still playing around with it and will post a review soon where I compare it to the 1000D.</intro>

    <subheader>Lucky shot</subheader>
    <intro>[image vertical-horizontal] This week's theme left a lot of room for interpretation. I was first planning to do something with two bubble levels I have, but taking photos at home seemed lazy. Instead, I got out for a photo walk and was lucky enough to get a shot of this crowded but somehow empty looking shopping mall. The open vertical architecture matches the theme good enough. Taken with the 600D + kit lens using the automatic depth of field setting, keeping things in focus all the way up.</intro>

    <header>Canon EOS 600D vs 1000D</header>
    <readableid>canon_eos_600d_vs_1000d</readableid>
    <subheader>Model numbers never make sense</subheader>
    <intro>[image both] I have used the Canon EOS 1000D for quite some time now, and felt it was time for an upgrade. Since I already have a few lenses, I decided to continue down the Canon path. The 600D - AKA Rebel T3i, or Kiss X5, depending on where you live - caught my eye, looking very similar but fixing some of the problems of the 1000D, like lack of video recording, low ISO sensitivity, and low quality LCD. Read on for a comparison between the two.</intro>
    <content>&lt;h2&gt;From the outside&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you would expect, the two cameras look very similar. I wish the 600D would have been available in pink or something so I could at least easily tell them apart!&lt;/p&gt;

[image 1000d_front]

[image 1000d_back]

[image 600d_front]

[image 600d_back]

&lt;h2&gt;The display&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I'm not going to go into resolutions or pixel density - to sum it up, the Canon 600D has a display that just pwns the 1000D. Larger, crisper, more flexible, more tasty etc. Interestingly, the images look much noisier on the 600D. Seems like it just renders the images more accurately. On the 1000D, the details get blurry when you zoom in. The 600D wins hands-down. Pixel-peepers rejoice!
&lt;/p&gt;

[image 600d_display]

&lt;h2&gt;ISO performance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 600D goes all the way to ISO 6400, with an additional "High-ISO" of 12800. The 1000D handles only up to 800, with its high-setting at ISO 1600. Below is a quick full crop comparison at ISO 1600.&lt;/p&gt;

[image 600d-1600]

[image 1000d-1600noreduction]

&lt;p&gt;The 600D has some more clarity and detail in the dark areas, while also increasing the resolution. I find the noise a bit unpleasant though. The 1000D just blurs everything instead of making noisy areas look like they are covered with dust. Interestingly, with noise reduction turned on on the 1000D, the blur is gone and we get the unpleasant dust look instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the noise performance of the 600D is better, it doesn't quite blow me away. 12800 looks dog-ugly, but can be quite usable if you are going for that grainy film-look. Goes great with black and white.&lt;/p&gt;

[image 600d-12800]

&lt;h2&gt;HD video&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Not much to say here. The 600D has it, and the 1000D has no video recording capabilities whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And interesting feature with the video recording however, is that you can take pictures while recording. There will be a short gap (frozen frame) in the video though, for about one second. Also, the image will have the same aspect ratio as the recorded video (16:9 or 4:3). The resolution of the pictures will be slightly lower than the full 18M since some cropping is required.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Also, the 600D can use cropping (digital zoom) when recording. Since Full HD video is about 2M, and the sensor has 18M, it can zoom up to 10x without (in theory) losing image quality. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;LiveView shooting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When the 1000D came out, LiveView - which means using the display instead of the optical viewfinder - was quite new. And it had a few quirks. To switch to LiveView, you press the Set button. To focus, you press that button with a star over it (usually used for locking metering settings). In quick mode, the mirror flips and the screen turns black, and then back on. The camera will not report where it got focus, so you need to have some faith. There is also LiveMode focus, where the screen does not turn black, but focusing takes like forever.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The 600D actually reports where it got focus, and you actually focus by pressing the shutter button half way. Just like people have been doing for centuries - now also for LiveView! Probably took weeks of brainstorming at Canon to come up with that.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Focus points&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The 600D has nine focus points, the 1000D seven. So is it a big deal? Well, to be honest - for me, the 1000D has only one focus point. The points are too few and too far apart, and when using more than a single - the middle one - too often the points far to the sides pick up focus. May not sound very dramatic, but very often I have had the subject in the center of the frame, and the camera keeps on focusing on the background or the foreground. Super annoying. I have no idea why Canon just didn't place all the points closer to the center. So it's not necessarily about the number of focus points, but the totally headless placement of them that makes the 1000D look bad. The 600D does much better. Plus, the middle point is a cross-type, which is apparently better.
&lt;/p&gt;

[image focus_points]

&lt;h2&gt;Other subtle differences&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The sound of the shutter&lt;/b&gt; and the mirror flipping has not improved. The 1000D has a high pitched, well, "ka-tsheeek"-like sound. Where "ka" is the mirror flipping up the shutter opening, and the "tsheeek" is the shutter closing and the mirror going back down. Just so you know. The 600D is a bit worse, with a slightly more high-pitched noise. This may be a reason to pony up for the 60D and get that fancy and subtle "ka-flurp" instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;You can now interact with the settings on the display&lt;/b&gt;. The 1000D would show you a lot of settings on the LCD, like drive mode, white balance and so on. On the 600D, you can press the brand new "Q"-button and then navigate around on the screen with the arrow keys and actually change settings directly from there. Not bad, since it gives you quite quick access to a bunch of useful stuff. And especially since they seem to have removed the dedicated Metering Mode button!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Exposure compensation&lt;/b&gt; goes between -5 and +5 on the 600D, compared to -2 to +2 on the 1000D. Personally, I think it should go from minus infinity to plus infinity (give or take some). But still an improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The creative modes&lt;/b&gt; may not be so subtle, but it's fun nonetheless so I'll just put it here. After taking a picture, you can apply effects to it, like grainy black and white, or Lomo effect. The effect will be applied to a copy of the image, keeping the original. Fun and simple in-camera editing, but it hardly beats Adobe Lightroom.&lt;/p&gt;

[image jump]

&lt;h2&gt;Things that annoyingly remained the same&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rotation of images&lt;/b&gt; is done by EXIF metadata. Some applications don't read this data and the orientation may end up wrong. Fine - not Canon's fault. However, when doing a "hard rotate" rotating 90 degrees using some Windows program for example, the camera will report the image file as corrupt. What, it can't read some simple JPEGs?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The weight&lt;/b&gt; has increased slightly. The body, with battery, weighs in at almost 600 grams. Why is this thing so heavy? I can understand that professionals don't mind, but I'm just an average consumer and I do. Many electronic products today are super small and super light, but these things apparently never change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The strap&lt;/b&gt; is still standard and super inconventient, offering zero flexibility, always getting in the way, is difficult to remove, and makes you more stupid. This will probably never improve.&lt;/p&gt;
[note]
The √úber-Pro tip of the day: turn the strap inside-out! The inside of the strap has some sort of rubber coating, and when wearing it crossbag-style, it often gets stuck when you move it from your hip to your eye to shoot, costing precious time. The outside of the strap (with the brand name on it) has no coating and slides easily. So just wear it with the logo facing inwards and you will be able to capture that Kodak... err, "Canon Moment".
[/note]

&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if you already own the 1000D, is it worth upgrading to the 600D and spending the next few months eating only cup noodles? As always, it depends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Get the 600D if you:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;are interested in high-quality video&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;could use some more ISO&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;want a better LiveView experience with clearer display that allows shooting from funny angles without getting your pants dirty&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;want a higher resolution (18M vs 10M)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;want spot metering&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Just stick with the 1000D if you:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;are looking for some something very different (much more compact, or professional-grade) - the two cameras are quite similar after all&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;prefer shooting with long exposure and tripod, or using a flash - here, the higher ISO sensitivity will not really help much&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;shoot using the optical viewfinder almost exclusively&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <intro>[image character] Last week, &lt;a href="http://www.fotosondag.se" target="_blank"&gt;Fotos√∂ndag.se&lt;/a&gt; arranged a "photo marathon" - one topic was published every hour starting from 9 am, for a total of six topics. The files were to be uploaded latest 5 pm on the same day, so time was really of the essence. Just found out I'm not among the winners, but it was a fun experience nonetheless.

Without a filter, I could not go slower that around 1/25 shutter speed, but the effect is still obvious. My hand, of course, spun along with the rest of me and stayed unblurred. Desaturated, bumped the contrast and voila! In-camera effects are the best. :)</intro>

The setup is similar to a typical &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwExpFDUC9Y" target="_blank"&gt;"splash shot"&lt;/a&gt; - that is, you fill a small bag with water (I used a juice carton with screw cap) which gives you a stream of drops at a steady rate. With the camera mounted on a tripod and using an external flash with reflector card, I regulated the flow of water so that it was nearly pouring, but still dripping, making perfect timing less of an issue. The lens was a vintage 55mm Pentax with a 25mm extension tube. Aperture f/8 and shutter speed 1/200th and some of trial and error gave nice results.</intro>

    <header>Gemei G9 Android Tablet Hands-on</header>
    <readableid>gemei_g9_android_tablet_hands-on</readableid>
    <subheader>Leave it to the chinese</subheader>
    <intro>[image onbox] I got the &lt;a href="/article/ask_731sp_3g_smartpad_review"&gt;ASK 731SP SmartPad&lt;/a&gt; about a year ago, and a recent trip to Hong Kong enabled me to get my paws on a more recent device. The Gemei G9 show just how much has happened on the Android tablet market the last year - for about the same price, you now get a much faster and cooler-looking unit. Read on for more.</intro>
    <content>[image onbox]

&lt;h2&gt;SmartPad vs G9&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing you notice is the screen. While the SmartPad was pretty small with its 7 inch display, the G9 is considerably larger, sporting a 9,7 inch display with a 1024x768 pixels resolution. In fact, the G9 is almost exactly 2x the size of the SmartPad. Here are some other key differences:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Faster CPU, 1.5GHz vs 660 MHz&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;16 GB internal memory vs 4 GB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two cameras, rear 5MP and front-facing 1.3MP (vs none)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Android 4.0.3 vs Android 2.1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

[image comparison]

[image case]

&lt;h2&gt;Ports and buttons&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from standard stuff - MicroSD slot, headphone jack, USB port, charging port - the G9 also has a USB host port and an HDMI port. I have tried getting the HDMI connection to work but I keep getting nothing (please post a reply if you happen to have any idea why).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strangely, the volume rocker and back button stopped working a few days ago. Luckily, they are not critical as you can use soft buttons instead, but it sort of makes you wish for world wide warranty for a short while.&lt;/p&gt;

[image back]

&lt;p&gt;The USB host function allows you to hook up a keyboard or mouse to it. I tried a USB hub and was able to connect a mouse, a keyboard and a USB stick - and it all worked!&lt;/p&gt;

[image mouse]

&lt;h2&gt;Web browsing and general usage&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The TL; DR version: Install Opera Mobile! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The built-in web browser is slow at rendering web pages, sometimes not rendering at all, and frequently crashes. I tried Dolphin but saw no improvement. Opera Mobile works much better though. It generally feels very fast and light-weight. Strongly recommended. That said, I still don't quite get why the stock browser works so poorly on this device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally, the tablet handles the GUI rendering just fine and the interface is snappy and is fun to work with. However, the tablet occasionally tends to hang for short moments when too much is going on. It has even led to the unit rebooting by itself a few times. Stability is serviceable but not great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Apps&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Android market, or Google Play, offers a lot of applications. I first tried out two that did not work on the SmartPad: Angry Birds and Skype.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went for &lt;b&gt;Angry Birds Seasons&lt;/b&gt; first. Much to my delight, it installed and played just fine, no complaints at all and a big step up from... nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next was &lt;b&gt;Skype&lt;/b&gt;. This, too, installed and ran. Much to my surprise, the front-facing camera even worked. Not perfectly, mind you - the other party could see you, but the colors were way off; magenta and cyan with large bars running through it (it does not do that when using the camera for shooting). Sound was ok though so it definitely passes in my book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;However...&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;3D games&lt;/b&gt; don't seem to work. I have tried running a few but none of them have worked so far, crashing on start. No biggie for me but still a shame. I did see a video of someone playing Shadowgun on the device though so it should be possible in some cases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Package file invalid error&lt;/b&gt; sometimes occurs when downloading an item from the market. Exiting, killing and restarting the market app seems to do the trick.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Not compatible with your device&lt;/b&gt; is another common message. Some apps don't seem to show up or don't want to install. TuneIn Radio for example. Downloading and installing the APK-file from elsewhere works though, and the app runs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I doubt anyone will buy this device as a DSLR replacement, but since it has two cameras, let's at least try out one of them. Here are some shots with the rear camera:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Final words&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the quality may not exactly be top-notch - buttons not working, flimsy USB cable, and the occasional crash - the tablet is still fun to use. Zooming and panning is fast, the screen is big and while no rocket, it's considerably faster than the SmartPad. For around 1800 Hong Kong dollars/175 EUR/230 USD, you do get a lot of tablet. If you don't mind a bit of fiddling and tweaking, and can accept a few flaws, you will have fun with this.&lt;/p&gt;

    <intro>[image sds] Since the Canon EOS 600D supports HD video, I went out and picked up a new SD card (full HD often uses around 300 MB for one minute of video). For more flexibility, I got a SanDisk Mobile Ultra micro-SD 16GB card with an SD adapter, so that I could use it in my cell phone or tablet. However, while recording was fine mostly, it would sometimes stop, the camera displaying the message 
"recording has been stopped automatically". Despite being a class 6 card, it seemed too slow. I picked up a SanDisk Extreme class 10 card instead, and I have had no problems since.</intro>

        <description>The cards. The SanDisk Extreme is a class 10 card, and does HD video just fine, while the Mobile Ultra card struggles. The difference is also obvious when shooting in burst mode: The buffer is emptied much faster on the Extreme, and with the buffer full, still manages almost 1 fps. The Mobile Ultra card only does around 0.5 fps, with more erratic performance.</description>

You can actually achieve a lot but simply pushing the contents of the burger (lettuce, gherkin slices) closer to the edge to make it visible to the camera. The image shows my (mixed) results. Clearly, making a "stock" burger perfect requires a bit more than that.</intro>

    <intro>[image keyhole] I wanted to make a picture on the theme "private", and experimented with light coming through a keyhole. I started by placing a fairly strong lamp on the other side of the hole. Unfortunately, the effect was not very dramatic since the light travelling through the hole was not visible in the air - this usually only happens if the air is dusty or foggy. I was considering opening the vacuum cleaner bag to fill the air with dust, but tried a cleaner method: Steam! I simply boiled a pot of water and put it under the keyhole. The light shining through the steam became visible and made for a much better shot.</intro>

    <header>Installing Android 2.3 Gingerbread on SonyEricsson Xperia X10 Mini Pro</header>
    <readableid>installing_android_2.3_gingerbread_on_sonyericsson_xperia_x10_mini_pro</readableid>
    <subheader>If it ain't broke, tweak it</subheader>
    <intro>[image home] I have had the SonyEricsson Xperia X10 Mini Pro for about two years, and its age is really starting to show. One weakness is the fact that it's still stuck with Android 2.1 (Eclair) with no update in sight. But before ponying up for a new phone, I wanted to see if there was any way to remedy this. And luckily, there is! This may be old news to some, but the nice people over at &lt;a href="http://cyanogenmod.com/" target="_blank"&gt;CyanogenMod&lt;/a&gt; have found ways to install custom Android firmwares, often including newer versions than your manufacturer offers. Read on for a short how-to on how to root and flash your phone with such a firmware.</intro>
    <content>&lt;h2&gt;About CyanogenMod&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Android cannot just be installed on any device, it needs to be customized for your phone first. Typically, this is done by the manufacturer itself. However, many manufacturers are slow or unwilling to release updates to their phones since it costs resources and they would obviously prefer that the customer buys a new phone instead of updating their existing one. So what to do when your phone is capable, but the manufacturer not? Answer: CyanogenMod. It is a customized version of Android - thank god for open source -  with some nice extra features added by the community, like USB tethering and CPU overclocking. A large number of devices are supported, fortunately including an Android 2.3.7 version for the Xperia X10 Mini Pro. Much further customization is also done over at &lt;a href="xda-developers.com" target="_blank"&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Some useful links:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/forumdisplay.php?f=727" target="_blank"&gt;XDA Developers X10 Mini Pro Development forum&lt;/a&gt; (very active with lots of great tutorials and a good place to start)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://forum.cyanogenmod.com/forum/471-sony-ericsson-xperia-x10-mini-pro-stable-mod/" target="_blank"&gt;CyanogenMod X10 Mini Pro forum page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://wiki.cyanogenmod.com/wiki/Sony_Ericsson_Xperia_X10_Mini_Pro" target="_blank"&gt;CyanogenMod X10 Mini pro wiki page&lt;/a&gt; (has a link to the firmware download)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CyanogenMod typically delivers pretty much a pure Android experience, which you may or may not like. The user interface of the X10 Mini Pro was customized to work well on a small screen. For example, you have application shortcuts in each corner of the screen, and each widget uses up a whole page. This will change after the update, unless you find a firmware (or possibly market app) with these special customizations.&lt;/p&gt;

[image standard_ui]

&lt;h2&gt;A word of warning&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Performing these steps will wipe all your data, void your warranty and may brick your phone, so don't do it. But you knew that already. ;)
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The steps below probably only work with the SonyEricsson Xperia X10 Mini Pro, although the process for other phones may be similar. Also, this is the way I did it. There may be better or safer ways. I recommend checking the links above to get a better understanding of the procedure before continuing.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some things (other than only the user interface) may not work after the update. My phone has a physical QWERTZ-keyboard and after the upgrade, I noticed it behaved like a QWERTY-layout. There are fixes though, check the &lt;a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=822050" target="_blank"&gt;XDA Developers forum thread&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How to: Steps overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Make a backup.&lt;/b&gt; Optional, but a good idea.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Root the device.&lt;/b&gt; This will allow applications to do a few interesting things, like changing system files.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Install BusyBox.&lt;/b&gt; Needed for the next step.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Install xRecovery.&lt;/b&gt; This program will perform the actual upgrade.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Downloading the update.&lt;/b&gt; There are several compatible firmwares, available directly from CyanogenMod or XDA Developers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Performing the update.&lt;/b&gt; That is, flashing the firmware.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;1. Making a backup&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Ok, I skipped this step (possibly hoping I would brick the phone and be forced to get a new one). The phone will be wiped completely so a backup of everything which is not on the SD card is in order. CyanogenMod recommends making a NANDroid backup of the current ROM. Also make sure all your contacts, calendar, apps etc. are backed up.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;2. Rooting the device&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In order to be able to change the system partition on the phone, we need root access (think administrator permissions). I used SuperOneClick as described in this how-to: &lt;a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/mobile/how-to-root-your-android-phone-device/" target="_blank"&gt;addictivetips.com&lt;/a&gt;. Worked like a charm. Just remember to enable USB debugging on the phone first.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;3. Installing BusyBox&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Needed for xRecovery to work. &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=stericson.busybox
" target="_blank"&gt;Get it here.&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;4. Installing xRecovery&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once installed, xRecovery can be started during boot. We will use it to wipe data from the phone (including cache) and performing the update. The program does the same as the ClockworkMod but according to some sources it cannot be installed on this device (haven't tried it myself though).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
A good guide on how to install xRecovery is available from &lt;a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/mobile/how-to-install-latest-xrecovery-to-sony-ericsson-xperia-x10/"&gt;addictivetips.com&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;5. Downloading the update&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
You need to use a firmware compatible with the device. &lt;a href="http://forum.cyanogenmod.com/topic/32777-cyanogenmod-7-for-the-xperia-x10-mini-pro-v710-11-oct-2011/" target="_blank"&gt;The one from CyanogenMod&lt;/a&gt; should be a good start. I ended up using &lt;a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1291845" target="_blank"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;, which has a Android 4-like look (still 2.3.7 though) and it has worked really well for me so far.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Download the Zip-file, rename to "update.zip" and copy to the root folder of the phone's SD card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;6. Performing the update&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Switch off the phone and switch it on again. While booting, press the back button repeatedly when the white "SonyEricsson" text is showing. xRecovery starts. Perform the following steps:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Factory reset (full wipe)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wipe cache partition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install update.zip from sd card (should this fail, try another firmware)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Factory reset (full wipe) (should make sure the system runs more stable)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wipe cache partition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All done! Reboot the phone and enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you would like to try another firmware, you now only have to perform steps 5 and 6 again (downloading and performing the update).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The result&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have to play around with it some more first. But in general, the user interface feels about as snappy as before, with some things (like opening a contact) being much faster. In general, the user interface has a nice feel to it and I'm quite happy. :)&lt;/p&gt;

    <intro>[image snow] I really like my 600D. It's responsive and delivers great quality pictures. But the lack of any shock- or weatherproofing plus the relatively high cost of it makes you think twice before bringing it in harm's way to get that special shot. I picked up the Olympus TG-310 a few months ago, &lt;a href="/article/new_toy_olympus_tough_tg-310"&gt;and blogged that I would write a short review&lt;/a&gt; on it. About time. ;)</intro>
    <content>[image snow]

&lt;h2&gt;Key specifications&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;14 Mpix resolution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3.6x zoom&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;720p video at 30 fps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1.5m/5ft shockproof&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3m/10ft waterproof&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got this camera for around 130 EUR (around 165 USD) but it has since been phased out and replaced by the TG-320. From what I can tell, it's pretty much exactly the same camera, with the same specs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;A few words about using it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, this camera does not really have anything that sets it apart from a regular point-and-shoot, except from the water-/shockproof thing. Here a quick summary of what I found using it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using the camera is very straightforward. &lt;b&gt;Just switch on and shoot.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;b&gt;delay&lt;/b&gt; from pressing the power button until the first picture is actually taken is &lt;b&gt;about 3-4 seconds&lt;/b&gt;. Compared to a the near-instant-on-and-shoot of DSLRs it feels like an eternity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;b&gt;dedicated video recording button&lt;/b&gt; is quite common nowadays and it's present here as well, which is nice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speaking of the buttons, they have a rubber cover to protect them from the elements. The unfortunate side effect is that &lt;b&gt;the buttons are difficult to press&lt;/b&gt;, and the fact that they are so small does not help. I sometimes find myself avoiding using the zoom just because of the buttons. My fingers hurt after pressing them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Focusing works well, at least in spot mode.&lt;/b&gt; Default is Face/iESP which basically means that the camera tries to be smarter than you but fails most of the time. Too often, the camera tends to focus on anything except the subject, and refocusing usually doesn't help. But spot mode is the best mode anyway so why bother.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Camera shake is a bit of a problem since shutter speeds tend to be a bit longer than necessary.&lt;/b&gt; The reason is that the default ISO auto setting is trying to keep a low ISO speed. Often you will get weird auto settings like 1/4th second shutter speed at ISO 250. &lt;b&gt;The ISO performance is subpar&lt;/b&gt; which we will get to later. The camera has an image stabilization system but I after some testing, I cannot really see it helping.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;The display is quite low-res and is unable to accurately reproduce colors.&lt;/b&gt; A common problem is that the highlights seem blown, when they in fact are not. It's quite sad actually, because it gives you the feeling that the images you shoot are all bad. Opening the images in the computer later might be a pleasant surprise, but don't expect to be blown away.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I haven't really measured how long the battery lasts, but it feels very short. It also &lt;b&gt;seems that the camera drains battery also when not in use.&lt;/b&gt;  Before bringing the camera somewhere, I usually switch it on first to check the battery, which too often is down to a single bar without apparent reason.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can charge it using a regular USB charger, but &lt;b&gt;the cable is neither mini-USB nor micro-USB&lt;/b&gt;, even though the size is similar. I thought we were over this by now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Image quality&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few sample shots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, the image quality is nothing to rave about. In most cases, your cell phone camera will do just as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Special situations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are some shots I would never have taken with my DSLR or smartphone, for different reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people have asked how I got the shot above. Here is the answer:&lt;/p&gt;

[image camera_attached_to_bike]

&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Pros&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Waterproof means more fun in water&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cheap (for a waterproof camera)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fairly small and light&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Macro mode gets you very close&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Could be used as a simple GoPro replacement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Cons&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Short battery life/drains battery when switched off&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Low-quality display&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lackluster ISO performance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Difficult to press buttons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So is it worth getting or not? Maybe not for everyday shooting. Even many simple point-and-shoots are snappier and deliver better pictures than the toy-like TG-310. And they don't suffer from hard to press buttons because of water sealing. However, there are certain places I just couldn't bring any compact, or my DSLR. The robustness and low price point of the Olympus means that you do not have to think twice about bringing it along to the beach, pool or ski slope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you don't need the best quality images, and can live with 720p video (&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lrlfZ6uIe0" target="_blank"&gt;sample&lt;/a&gt;), pick it up, tape it to your surfing board and just have fun. ;)&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <subheader>Invisible flash</subheader>
    <intro>[image with_ir] I have an external flash gun that I often use when shooting. Using it on the camera is alright, but when you start using it off camera, things really start to get interesting. To trigger the flash remotely, I simply use the built-in pop-up flash of the camera. Problem is, this often causes some unwanted light or shadows from the pop-up flash itself. The solution? An infrared filter. Hold it (or tape it?) in front of the built-in flash and it will filter out almost all visible light, but still trigger the external flash. Works great.

    <intro>[image one] I was close to missing the deadline for this week's submission, which was "One". Being out with some friends instead and not having the camera with me didn't exactly help either - or so I thought. After loosing at darts, however, I did get an idea, which also reflected my darts skills. When shooting, I had to resort to the cellphone I had with me, an HTC Wildfire S. Being a fan of DSLRs, I was sceptical, but I like how the little camera manages to keep almost everything in focus. The shadows may be noisy, and the left side a bit blurry, but I got the shot and I like it. But don't expect me to ditch the DSLR anytime soon! ;)</intro>

    <intro>[image lenses]I have been using the Canon 50mm more and more lately, mostly because it is small and light, making it easy to carry around. However, the quality of the lens is terrible, even bordering to &lt;a href="/article/canon_50mm_1.8_stuck_on_camera_body"&gt;hazardous&lt;/a&gt;. The Canon 40mm 2.8, which is even more compact but offers superior build quality, seemed like a good alternative. Since I just picked this one up, I haven't been shooting with it much yet, but expect a rundown soon. Amazingly, now my DSLR fits into my coat pocket!</intro>

    <subheader>Clash of the Minuscules</subheader>
    <intro>[image 50mm_and_40mm] The Canon 50mm 1.8 "Plastic Fantastic" is an interesting lens. With its sub 100 USD price, basically anyone should pick it up just to see what it's like to shoot with a fast prime. However, since Canon introduced the 40mm 2.8 pancake lens, the 50mm may no longer be the obvious choice for a reasonably priced second lens. I happen to have both now, but which one would I have chosen if I could choose today? Read on for a (subjective) comparison between the two.</intro>
    <content>[image 50mm_and_40mm]

&lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Canon introduced the 40mm pancake lens, I was a bit confused. A more compact lens sounded great, but why 40mm? It's not a normal lens on full frame or crop sensor. Also, the aperture was a mere f/2.8 compared to f/1.8 of the cheap 50mm. At almost twice the price and without any features like optical image stabilizer, it seemed like a pretty weak product - possibly saved by the attractive compact format. Now, the price has dropped a bit, and I broke down and ordered the 40mm. So let's put the 40mm and the 50mm head-to-head to see which one wins!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Build Quality&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Usually I wouldn't feel that the build quality is very important; as long as the lens delivers it could be made out of styrofoam for all I care. However, the build quality of the 50mm is absolutely terrible so I need to make an exception. It once got stuck on the camera body, and it once literally fell apart - the inner part containing the front element just fell out. Luckily it could be forced back in but you start to understand why this thing costs so little.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The 40mm on the other hand, feels incredibly solid for its size. The metal mount is not just a nice touch; it most probably helps preventing the stuck-on-body situation I had with the 50mm.
&lt;/p&gt;

[image mounts]

&lt;p&gt;
Maybe you wonder what "STM" means? STepper Motor, apparently - a technology that enables near-silent focusing. It is audible, but more quiet (and pleasant) than the noise of the 50mm. Interestingly, the focus is by-wire: The focus ring is actually not physically attached to the focusing mechanism, but uses a sensor to control the motor. This has the side effect that the lens must be mounted on a camera, and the camera must be switched on for manual focus to work. Oh well.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Size matters&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Being a pancake lens, it's obvious that an advantage of the 40mm is its small size.
&lt;/p&gt;

[image 40mm_side]

[image 50mm_side]

[image kit_side]

&lt;h2&gt;Non-scientific, subjective walkaround testing results&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I brought the two lenses with me and went for a photo walk.&lt;/p&gt;

[note]
On focal lengths and shutter speeds: The shots were taken with a Canon 600D, which is a crop sensor camera. That means a smaller sensor is used than on a full-frame camera, and the focal lengths therefore are 1.6 times longer. So 50mm actually equals 80mm and 40mm equals 64mm. To avoid camera shake, the rule of thumb is focal length "equal to" shutter speed: The 50mm then needs 1/80th of a second on this camera, and the 40mm 1/64th.

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Macro&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of these lenses are macro lenses, but let's see how well they perform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more shots taken with the 40mm, check out the &lt;a href="/images/36"&gt;Image Gallery&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if I would start anew and were to choose between the two lenses, which one would it be? To sum it up:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Canon 50mm 1.8: Pros&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cheap&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fast (by one and a half stop - however the image quality suffers at large apertures)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Canon 40mm 2.8 STM Pancake: Pros&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Very small&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Razor-sharp, even at 2.8&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quiet (but not silent) auto focus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good build quality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More usable focal length&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focuses reasonably close&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel that the 50mm cannot produce good quality until around f/2.5 or so, weakening its main strong point - the f/1.8 aperture. So while the 50mm is a good choice, I would shell out a little (very little extra, actually) for the 40mm. I also feel more comfortable with a lens that is less likely to just fall apart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So for me, the Canon 40mm 2.8 STM Pancake is the winner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Post Script&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, I still feel that both lenses are a bit awkward to shoot with, because of the focal lengths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
50mm works very well on a full frame camera, simply because it is a normal lens and it feels natural to shoot at that focal length. However, full frame cameras are rather expensive. So would you really shell out over a thousand dollars on a camera body, and then less than a hundred on a lens? I hope not. A hundred dollar lens would probably go together much better with the popular and cheaper APS-C (crop sensor) cameras. Hovever, such a camera would need a 30mm (or so) focal length, and no such cheap lenses exist. 40mm works better than 50mm though in my opinion, without getting too expensive. So we are slowly getting there - 10mm at a time. ;)
&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>This shot was taken at aperture f/1.8 and we can see how vignetting creeps in and how the text is less sharp than the above image. This is not only due to the shorter depth of field; the lens just isn't sharp at f/1.8.</description>

    <intro>[image box] The free and hopefully fun to use Shiny Icon Maker just learned a new trick: Saving and loading icons. After creating that super-cool icon, maybe you want to save it on the website for later use. And now you can! You can save up to five icons and load them later. Note that the feature uses the LocalStorage in the web browser, so you need to use the same machine and the same web browser to load them later. &lt;a href="/iconmaker"&gt;Try it out!&lt;/a&gt;</intro>

    <header>Short review: Logitech K400r vs Plexgear Mediatrack Ergo</header>
    <readableid>short-review-logitech-k400r-vs-plexgear-mediatrack-ergo</readableid>
    <subheader>Keyboards for the couch potato</subheader>
    <intro>[image touchpad] I have just recently hooked up a dedicated PC to my TV to use it as a media center. This obviously calls for a suitable device to operate it with. I am not ready to ditch the keyboard for a "real" remote just yet, so in order to comfortably control the PC from the couch, I looked at two options: The Logitech K400r and the Plexgear Mediatrack Ergo (AKA MCSaite W9710RF AKA Generic Wireless Trackball Keyboard). Read on for a short review and comparison.</intro>
    <content>&lt;h2&gt;Two keyboards - one concept&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The two devices build on the same concept - provide a nice keyboard for the couch, with mouse functionality. They also cost about the same - around some 45 EUR.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I like about both keyboards is that they offer different options how to move the mouse depending on whether you are holding the device or have put it on a flat surface. Logitech allows clicking on the left side, Plexgear takes it a step further by also adding a right mouse button, and a clickable scrollwheel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Plexgear&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The first thing that struck me when I held the Plexgear keyboard was that it felt like a huge gaming controller. You hold it comfortably on each side and can operate the trackball with your right thumb, clicking with the right index finger and scrolling with the left. This quite comfortable, especially when you use the keyboard without a flat surface - like standing up, or having it on your lap. There are mouse buttons on the left as well.
&lt;/p&gt;

[image plexgear]

[image leftmouse]

[image mousewheel]

[image trackball]

&lt;p&gt;
The layout of the mouse buttons and trackball opens up some interesting possibilities - while it may not beat a real mouse and keyboard, it worked surprisingly well to play casual FPS:es with this thing. With the Logitech, this was a rather awkward experience.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Logitech&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of a trackball, Logitech went with a multi-touch touchpad. Like the Plexgear, you can move the mouse with your right thumb and click with your left - they actually added a click button to the top left. If on a flat surface, a better way to operate it might be to left-click with the button under the touchpad, or by using the touchpad itself. Right-clicking is done by a two-finger tap, scrolling by moving two fingers. This may take a while to get used to.&lt;/p&gt;

[image logitech]

&lt;h2&gt;Typing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Both keyboards feel a bit light and cheap, and none provide a numeric keyboard, so I don't recommend using any of these if you type a lot. That said, the Logitech is the clear winner here. The keys are large and the layout pretty much what you'd expect. It is also quiet to type on.
&lt;/p&gt;

[image logitech_layout]

&lt;p&gt;
The Plexgear is more difficult to type on, and feels and sounds very plasticky - as opposed to the Logitech's rather rubbery feel. The layout is a but unusual, and I often found myself pressing the context menu button to the bottom right, thinking it was where the right arrow should be. And the left Alt key is not immediately next to the space key, which I am used to.
&lt;/p&gt;

[image plexgear_layout]

&lt;p&gt;
No big deal it may seem, but I never felt at home typing on the Plexgear. The Logitech could do with some more dedicated media buttons instead of combining them with the function keys, but it still wins hands down. (Note on the media keys: For a combination like Alt-F4, it is not necessary to press the FN key. Good thinking there.)
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Reception and the receivers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Basically - reception is about the same. I thought I would be able to connect the receiver to the back of the PC and have good reception from my couch some 3 meters away, but the signal was sporadic at best - with both keyboards. I used a cable to bring the receiver to the front and that did the trick. I was expecting a bit more but that's just life I guess.
&lt;/p&gt;

[image plexgear_receiver]

[image logitech_receiver]

&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Plexgear: Pros&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feels and plays like a gaming controller&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dedicated scroll wheel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Plexgear: Cons&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plasticky&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Difficult to type on&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Patchy build quality (had to return two because buttons not working etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plexgear is not even a brand, this is actually a generic chinese product with a logo slapped on&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
 
&lt;h3&gt;Logitech: Pros&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Small receiver&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Typing experience basically like regular keyboard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
 
&lt;h3&gt;Logitech: Cons&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two-finger scrolling with the touchpad a bit awkward (dedicated scrolling wheel on the left side of the keyboard would have been cool)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In conclusion, I would say Logitech is the winner. I liked just holding the Plexgear, but typing is much better on the Logitech. And I cannot quite recommend the Plexgear because they seem to have some quality control issues - although you might be luckier than me.
&lt;/p&gt;

    <header>DSLR vs cell phone camera vs digicam</header>
    <readableid>dslr-vs-cell-phone-camera-vs-digicam</readableid>
    <subheader>Next up: Apples vs Oranges</subheader>
    <intro>[image teaser] I recently picked up the Nexus 4, and it's the first time I find myself really using a cell phone as a camera. Obviously, a DSLR has better image quality, but just how much better? I compared the Nexus 4 to the Canon 600D (AKA T3i) to find out - and also threw in the the compact point and shoot Olympus TG-310 for good fun.</intro>
    <content>&lt;h2&gt;The contestants&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Canon 600D/T3i&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good all-round entry level DSLR, which retails for around 500 USD. I will be using the 18-55mm (f/3.5-5.6) kit lens in all tests. Just like a cell phone, the kit lens is light and flexible, and it's what many people use.&lt;/p&gt;

[image canon]

&lt;h3&gt;The LG Google Nexus 4&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Equipped with an 8 megapixel sensor for taking pictures, and a large, bright screen for viewing them. Can be picked up for around 350 USD.&lt;/p&gt;

[image nexus]

&lt;h3&gt;Olympus TG-310&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Waterproof and shockproof, but how is the image quality? We'll see how this holds up against the others. It's a bit older and off the market by now, but its (very similar) successor, the TG-320 can be had for around 150 USD, making it the cheapest of the bunch.&lt;/p&gt;

[image olympus]

So its Canon 600D/T3i vs LG Google Nexus 4 vs Olympus TG-310 - which one will win? Let's find out.

&lt;h2&gt;Round 1: Subject Isolation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isolating the subject using a shallow depth of field can be super-useful, especially for portrait shots and when the background is messy. A large sensor and wide aperture is usually needed for the effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Person-sized object&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because no one would sign a model release. ;)&lt;/p&gt;

[image 09_canon]

[image 09_nexus]

[image 09_olympus]

&lt;h3&gt;Close up&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting closer usually creates a more shallow depth of field.&lt;/p&gt;

[image 03_canon]

[image 03_nexus]

[image 03_olympus]

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Subject isolation:&lt;/b&gt; The Canon is clearly the Bokeh Master - but it needs something better than the kit lens to shine.&lt;/p&gt;

[note]
While it works well for portraits, a shallow DOF could be a problem sometimes - what if you want everything in focus? And what if there is only little light available? The DSLR then needs to stop down, maybe to f/11 which would increase the exposure time significantly. Cell phones and compacts (mostly) do not suffer from this problem.
[/note]

&lt;h2&gt;Round 2: Dynamic Range&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good camera can capture both dark and bright areas in a scene, without over- or underexposing.&lt;/p&gt;

[image 01_canon]

[image 01_nexus]

[image 01_olympus]

[image 08_canon]

[image 08_nexus]

[image 08_nexus_hdr]

[image 08_olympus]

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dynamic range:&lt;/b&gt; Interestingly, the Canon did not outperform the other cameras as much as I thought it would. But its exposure generally looks more correct so it still wins in my book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Round 3: Zooming&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some say approaching the subject is the best way of shooting. However, a zoom is useful in many situations. At the zoo for example, unless you want to get social with the bears.&lt;/p&gt;

[image 04_canon]

[image 04_nexus]

[image 04_olympus]

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Zooming:&lt;/b&gt; Having one is better than not having one. No clear winner, but the cell phone loses this round.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Round 4: Macro&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just how close can you get?&lt;/p&gt;

[image 05_canon]

[image 05_nexus]

[image 05_olympus]

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Macro:&lt;/b&gt; The Olympus takes this one. The Canon would probably win if it could use a macro lens, but that would be cheating.&lt;/p&gt;

[note]
√úber-Pro Tip of the Day: The DSLR has a trick up its sleeve when it comes to macro. By unscrewing the lens and holding it backwards in front of the camera, you can use it as a macro lens and get extremely close. But without special equipment (like duct tape) you cannot mount the lens this way and it's a rather awkward way of shooting - plus you might get dust in the camera.
[/note]

&lt;h2&gt;Round 5: Low-light&lt;/h2&gt;

[image 06_canon]

[image 06_nexus]

[image 06_olympus]

[image 07_canon]

[image 07_nexus]

[image 07_olympus]

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Low-light:&lt;/b&gt; DSLRs reign supreme here, with good noise performance and high ISO speeds. But the cell phones are picking up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To sum it up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;The DSLR&lt;/b&gt; has the best noise performance, dynamic range, highest resolution, and it can create the shallowest depth of field. It also offers a lot of manual control. If it's only about image quality, this is the best choice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;The compact&lt;/b&gt; has an optical zoom which should not be understated. It is also quite cheap and small. As an added bonus, this particular model is 10ft waterproof. However, its mediocre image quality and lackluster low-light performance makes it a poor choice in many situations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;The cell phone&lt;/b&gt; has an image quality comparable to a compact, but it lacks many manual controls, like shutter speed. On the other hand, it's very quick and easy to use. Possibly, its main strength lies in always being with you, and other stuff like image editing apps and sharing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So while the DSLR still has the best image quality, the cell phones are closer than one might think. Still, using a DSLR is also about being in control, and being able to use the camera with additional equipment like flash guns, tripods, remote triggers - and of course, lenses. But if that's not your thing, a cell phone should be enough in the vast majority of situations.&lt;/p&gt;

    <subheader>Sharpest tool in the shed</subheader>
    <intro>[image 40mm-2.8] I was recently asked by a reader if I could do a comparison between the Canon kit lens (EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS II), the Canon 50mm "Plastic Fantastic" (EF 50mm 1:1.8 II) and the Canon 40mm pancake (EF 40mm f/2.8) with respect of sharpness. I was a bit curious myself, so I went out and took a few shots. I also included the Tamron 18-270 DI II. Read on for more.</intro>
    <content>&lt;h2&gt;The contestants&lt;/h2&gt;

[image lenses]

&lt;h2&gt;Fully open&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first shot is with the aperture fully open, which means different things for the different lenses - from f/1.8 of the 50mm all the way to f/5 on the kit lens. The focal lengths also differ slightly, from 40mm to 50mm, with the zoom lenses set to around 42mm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Whole picture, resized&lt;/h3&gt;

[image 40mm-2.8-crop-edge]

[image tamron-4-crop-edge]

&lt;h2&gt;A bit of cheating&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you might have noticed above, the 50mm has a very "interesting" look fully open, so here are a few shots at f/2.8 aperture.&lt;/p&gt;

[image 50mm-2.8]

[image 50mm-2.8-crop-edge]

[image 50mm-2.8-crop-middle]


&lt;h2&gt;At f/5.6&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stopped down to f/5.6, all lenses should be sharper. It also comes closer to comparing apples to apples since all lenses use the same aperture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Whole picture, resized&lt;/h3&gt;

[image 50mm-5.6-crop-edge]

[image 40mm-5.6-crop-edge]

[image kit-5.6-crop-edge]

[image tamron-5.6-crop-edge]

&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To sum it up, the prime lenses here have shown to be noticeable sharper (and also faster) than the zoom lenses. Which was exactly what you might have expected. :) Anyway, here are my personal, more specific conclusions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The 40mm is razor sharp. Period.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The 50mm has a very strange glow to it fully open. It almost looks like a Photoshop filter. At f/2.8 the glow is gone and the lens is really sharp. Strangely, at f/5.6, the lens is less sharp - I would assume it did just not focus properly in this case.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Canon kit lens is slow and is also the least sharp of the bunch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stopped down to f/5.6, the Tamron is actually reasonably sharp. With it's massive zoom range and optical image stabilization, it might not be the worst lens after all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</content>

    <subheader>World's smallest IKEA hack</subheader>
    <intro>[image pad] The Nexus 4 may have been superseded, but anyone still using it probably still struggles with its (great looking) slippery flat back, which makes it slide off most slightly slanted surfaces and also muffling the speaker when placed on its back. Easy fix for that: get a rubber bumper pad - eg. from IKEA - and stick it to the back next to the speaker. The rubber stops it from sliding, and since it's lifted up slightly, it lets more sound from the speaker out (demuffling!). I carry my phone in my pocket and the pad has stayed on for several weeks so it's fairly durable too. Good luck!</intro>

    <readableid>hands-on-cheap-interchangeable-cell-phone-lenses</readableid>
    <subheader>That L glass is too heavy anyway</subheader>
    <intro>[image lenses] Shooting with a smart phone is fun! As one tends too keep it close at all times, capturing that special moment has gotten so much easier. But what if you are tired of that limiting, fixed focal length lens - is there a way to change it? Turns out, there are quite a few options. Mostly for fun, I ordered a set of three lenses - one which also doubles as a macro lens - and took them for a spin. For less than 10 USD, what can go wrong? Read on for more.</intro>
    <content>&lt;h2&gt;What's in the package?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The packaging is pretty minimalistic, but you get exactly what you need. As a bonus, apart from the lenses there is also an incomprehensible manual included, which has some fine examples of Engrish. Like this one:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;It shoule be grateful to use the phone if the camera lens at the center, on direct absorption in the Ring to use.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I guess you need to be grateful when mounting it? Or something. Beats me.&lt;/p&gt;

[image package]

[image caps]

&lt;p&gt;The lenses have rubber lens caps. The back is magnetic and the supplied metal covers can be put on when not in use. The string could be attached to a keychain I guess, but by doing so, you will probably loose the lens - magnets are only so strong!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How to use&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pay close attention now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So is this something you need for your cell phone? Well... as always, it depends. While the lenses look pretty, they don't deliver much in terms of quality if that's what you are looking for. Also, the handling is poor - the ring keeps sticking to the lens when I change lenses, so I have to keep reattaching it to the phone. But still, for the price, they are fun toys that keeps you busy for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternate use: You could probably also attach them to a webcam, or something like a D-Link DCS IP camera for a full 180 degree view of the room. Possibly more suitable for this than a cell phone since quality is not really a concern.&lt;/p&gt;

    <intro>[image responsive] I have been using &lt;a href="http://highslide.com/" target="_blank"&gt;HighSlide&lt;/a&gt; for quite some time for the image gallery now, and felt it was time for an update, especially since it never worked well on smartphones. A quick google didn't immediately yield what I was looking for, so I implemented a simple image slideshow thingy using JavaScript and CSS. It is still a bit rough around the edges - works well on Nexus 4 and most modern browsers though -  but should scale better on mobile devices and also look great on a PC. &lt;a href="http://www.erikmoberg.net/images/37"&gt;Try it out if you like.&lt;/a&gt;</intro>

    <subheader>This was easier in the 90s</subheader>
    <intro>[image android] Had a stupid problem today. I just wanted to set a certain MP3 file as an alarm on my Nexus 4, but the default song selection box did not include a way to browse the file system. Also, putting the file in the Notifications or Alarms folders did not show the file, not even after a reboot. Then I simply went to Settings ‚Üí Apps ‚Üí All ‚Üí Media Storage and tapped "Clear defaults" under "Launch by default". Now, when I tap to select an alarm sound, I get the option to use the ES File Explorer I happened to have installed. Just browse to the file, done. Any side effects? Possibly. But the only one I have noticed so far is that I can use the file explorer for the ring tones selection as well, which is pretty neat.</intro>

    <intro>[image charge] Just a little idea I got when I was on vacation: My phone, which I use a lot, kept running out of battery and I didn't have a battery pack. However, I had my trusty ol' Android tablet with me. Tablets often have quite large batteries, this one had 4000 mAh which is about the same as a (slightly below average) battery pack. Using the host USB port, I could charge the phone when I was out. It's quite a lot bigger and heavier than a battery pack to lug around, but at least I didn't have to break my back... erm, I mean, the bank.</intro>

    <intro>Had this problem the other day. I was trying to import images and videos from a phone, but the videos did not show up on the import tab. After some googling, it seems that if the proper video codec is missing, Picasa may have problems playing back video files. Windows Media Player was able to play the files, so thought everything was OK - but after identifying (using &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.headbands.com/gspot/"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;) and installing the codec manually, the files showed up in Picasa and everything was fine and dandy. :)</intro>

    <header>Experiment: Shooting art with cheap lenses</header>
    <readableid>experiment-shooting-art-with-cheap-lenses</readableid>
    <subheader>Analog to digital conversion</subheader>
    <intro>[image org] A dear reader asked if the Canon 40mm 2.8 pancake is any good for shooting paintings. While I figured that it would be, I decided to compare the 40mm to the 50mm 1.8 and the 18-55mm kit lens to see which one would be more suitable. Please read on for the 3 test shots - 1 will shock you and blow your mind! Not. ;) </intro>
    <content>&lt;h2&gt;What are we looking for?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to shoot a painting - or a framed picture in this case - the lens should have very little distortion or the paiting will look awkwardly bent. Also, we want good sharpness all the way out to the edges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While not the primary focus of this article, lighting is a quite big issue. You will want even lighting and also avoid reflections. Two or more soft boxes would be useful, or two or more strobes. However, I have only one strobe and that will create some unwanted shadows as we will see. :(&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Setup&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A framed poster will serve as subject. It measures 72x52 cm and hangs on a wall. To make sure the picture looks flat, the camera should be at the exact same height as the center of the picture - a tripod is great here. We will use a flash and bounce agains the ceiling to get controllable, even lighting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The camera is a Canon 600D (crop sensor camera). Aperture is set to f/11 for all lenses for good sharpness, shutter speed is 1/200th and ISO set to 100. The small aperture, fast shutter speed and low ISO will make sure to keep unwanted ambient lighting and reflections to a minimum.&lt;/p&gt;

[image org]

&lt;h2&gt;The results&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Canon 18-55mm kit lens @55mm&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shot around 2.5 meters from the subject.&lt;/p&gt;

[image 55-mm]

[image 55-mm-corner]

&lt;h3&gt;Canon 50 mm 1.8&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shot around 2.5 meters from the subject.&lt;/p&gt;

[image 50-mm]

[image 50-mm-corner]

&lt;h3&gt;Canon 40 mm 2.8&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shot around 2 meters from the subject.&lt;/p&gt;

[image 40-mm]

[image 40-mm-corner]

&lt;h3&gt;All three at once&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don't we all love animated gifs? Anyway, it should help some in comparing the distortion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="articleimage"&gt;
&lt;image src="/content/images/distortion-40-50-55.gif" alt="Distortion comparison" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both the 40mm and 50mm seem to be up for the job sharpness-wise, with the 50mm having slightly less distortion and the 40mm providing slighty more vibrant colors (in my case). So basically a toss-up. Also, Photoshop has filters for reducing distortion, which you might want to look into.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, even lighting is critical, and I felt the lighting in my setup was not quite good enough. Another flash or a couple of soft boxes should help here.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <subheader>It might be ugly, but hey - it's just cardboard</subheader>
    <intro>[image google-cardboard] I have difficulties getting the magnet slider to work with the Nexus 4. The phone sometimes reacts if slid out far to the left, but that does not feel like a solution. So I thought: The magnet simply causes a tap. Why not just tap the screen directly? So with a finger sized carved out hole on the side of the headset signed yours truly, tapping the phone's screen is just as simple as sliding the magnet. Not pretty, but it works. :)</intro>

    <subheader>From the Mixed Security dept.</subheader>
    <intro>Had this strange problem the other day. I was trying to download Windows Management Framework from microsoft.com, but no download would start, no matter how many times I tried or how long I waited. But I finally found a way to make it work:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bring up the developer tools (F12)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click the console tab&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Note the blocked HTTP-request(s). Clicking on each will start the download.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Turns out the page is served over HTTPS, but the download over HTTP for whatever reason. Trying to change HTTPS to HTTP only led to a redirect back to HTTPS in this case so it seems liberate but not quite thought through.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now, have fun downloading frameworks and tools for your windows PC!</intro>

    <header>Fixing Broken Breaks on Maclaren Techno XLR Buggy</header>
    <readableid>fixing-broken-breaks-on-maclaren-techno-xlr-buggy</readableid>
    <subheader>Yes, we have entered baby territory</subheader>
    <intro>[image maclaren-techno-xlr] For reasons that may be related to my absence from this blog lately, I found myself in a situation with a used baby stroller in need of repairs. The problem was that the breaks would not click into place. After looking into it, it turned out that it could be easily fixed with some spare parts bought online, plus some basic tools and, of course, my not-so-valuable spare time. Read on for a step for step guide.</intro>
    <content>[image maclaren-techno-xlr]

&lt;h2&gt;The Problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In my case, the cause turned out to be worn down brake cogs. They are made of plastic and as they wear down over time, the breaks will have a harder time of working properly.
&lt;/p&gt;

[image the-problem]

&lt;h2&gt;The Solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Luckily, new cogs can be purchased online. A suitable shop is just a &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://bfy.tw/5smB"&gt;quick google away.&lt;/a&gt; The wheels are held in place by 8mm star locks (wheel retainers),  three per axle, so you need to get a few of these as well. 
&lt;/p&gt;

[image damaged-starlock]

[image starlocks-removed]

[image comparison]

[image washer]

[image new-starlock]

[image two-starlocks]

[image ok]

&lt;h2&gt;Possible alternative solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I have noticed that the front wheels have identical brake cogs, even though there are no front breaks. The cogs in the front also do not seem to wear nearly as much as the ones in the back. This means you could probably use the front cogs as spare parts and simply switch them with the ones in the back. This is a little more work, but you also save a little since you only need to purchase star locks and no new brake cogs.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
While there are still a few things to be brushed up on this particular stroller, having the brakes working properly certainly increases safety quite a bit. Definitely worth my time and the small investment.
&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <subheader>Luigi says: Don't repeat yourself</subheader>
    <intro>[image logo] Just starting out creating a 2D game using Unity3D, I came across a simple problem: There seems to be no easy way to swap out the sprite in an animation (think: Luigi using the same animations as Mario). It may seem simple to just create a new animation, but with many different characters (sprites) using the same animation it gets old fast. Read on for a short explanation and some code.</intro>
    <content>&lt;p&gt;
Note: A solution based on the same approach is also described in &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMCLWt1DuqI"&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt; starting at 20:00. The link to the source code is broken, however.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It is assumed that you have already done the following:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Imported the sprite sheets and split them up in sprites accordingly, making sure corresponding sprites have the same name&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Created one or more animations from the sprites&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

[image spriteeditor]

[image resources]

[image animation]

&lt;p&gt;
Now, in order to swap out the sprite programmatically, we create the following script and add it to the game object:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;
using System.Linq;

public class SpriteSwapDemo : MonoBehaviour
{
    // The name of the sprite sheet to use
    public string SpriteSheetName;

    // The name of the currently loaded sprite sheet
    private string LoadedSpriteSheetName;

    // The dictionary containing all the sliced up sprites in the sprite sheet
    private Dictionary&amp;amp;lt;string, Sprite&amp;amp;gt; spriteSheet;

    // The Unity sprite renderer so that we don't have to get it multiple times
    private SpriteRenderer spriteRenderer;

    // Use this for initialization
    private void Start()
    {
        // Get and cache the sprite renderer for this game object
        this.spriteRenderer = GetComponent&amp;amp;lt;SpriteRenderer&amp;amp;gt;();

        this.LoadSpriteSheet();
    }

    // Runs after the animation has done its work
    private void LateUpdate()
    {
        // Check if the sprite sheet name has changed (possibly manually in the inspector)
        if (this.LoadedSpriteSheetName != this.SpriteSheetName)
        {
            // Load the new sprite sheet
            this.LoadSpriteSheet();
        }

        // Swap out the sprite to be rendered by its name
        // Important: The name of the sprite must be the same!
        this.spriteRenderer.sprite = this.spriteSheet&amp;amp;#91;this.spriteRenderer.sprite.name&amp;amp;#93;;
    }

    // Loads the sprites from a sprite sheet
    private void LoadSpriteSheet()
    {
        // Load the sprites from a sprite sheet file (png). 
        // Note: The file specified must exist in a folder named Resources
        var sprites = Resources.LoadAll&amp;amp;lt;Sprite&amp;amp;gt;(this.SpriteSheetName);
        this.spriteSheet = sprites.ToDictionary(x =&amp;amp;gt; x.name, x =&amp;amp;gt; x);

        // Remember the name of the sprite sheet in case it is changed later
        this.LoadedSpriteSheetName = this.SpriteSheetName;
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
By changing the parameter "Sprite Sheet Name", we can apply a different sprite sheet at runtime.
&lt;/p&gt;

    <subheader>As good as new... still old though</subheader>
    <intro>[image board] I have a 42" 42XV556D Toshiba Regza TV at home. While it started showing its age a few years ago, I rather keep using it a while longer instead of contributing to the local landfill. However, the power button just stopped working recently. Turned out fixing it is rather easy though, and a no-brainer considering the warranty expired a long time ago. Read on for a quick how-to.</intro>
    <content>&lt;h2&gt;A word of warning&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be careful after removing the back cover of the TV as there is a risk of electric shock. Before starting, remove the power cord and preferably let the TV sit without power for a day. Also, I cannot be held accountable for damages cased by following this guide and yadda yadda.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>The button does not push directly on a switch, but on a flat plastic piece, which in turn pushes on the switch. Almost as if the button was installed at the wrong height. Since the button pushes not in the center, but close to the edge, it puts stress on the plastic piece which might break over time.</description>

    <header>Review: Razer DeathAdder Left-Hand Edition</header>
    <readableid>review-razer-deathadder-left-hand-edition</readableid>
    <subheader>Save the southpaws</subheader>
    <intro>[image razer-deathadder-left] I have been considering getting another mouse to use with my left hand to relieve the right hand from some stress. And yes, that means I am not a left hander myself. I hope I am still allowed to write this review! While symmetrical mice are all around, finding a pure left handed design is easier said than done. Read on for my thoughts on the Razer DeathAdder - Left Hand Edition.</intro>
    <content>[image razer-deathadder-left]

&lt;h2&gt;Why a pure left-hand mouse?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
While a symmetrical mouse would get the job done, certainly a proper left-hand design is not too much to ask for. No only with the back and forward buttons properly placed - next to each other instead of on opposite sides - but also the primary and secondary buttons switched. This means that you can left-click using the index finger without having to switch the buttons in software. This is especially interesting if you use remote desktop, because on the remote machine, the settings for the buttons will be set to default - meaning left-clicking is now right-clicking, but only in the remote session. Sounds confusing? Well, it is! But a mouse with the proper wiring, such as the DeathAdder, solves this.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Design and ergonomics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Since this mouse is marketed toward gamers, it is expected to have a few bells and whistles, design-wise. In my opinion, it still seems fairly subtle - and all-black design with five buttons. It's mostly the LED-equipped wheel and logo that are drawing attention to themselves. On the default setting, the wheel is constantly lit while the logo slowly pulsates - both of which can be switched off with the Razer Synapse software.
&lt;/p&gt;

[image back]

&lt;p&gt;The mouse feels great in the hand, and the feet are, as the packaging says, ultra-slick. You will be in for a smooth ride.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Usage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Usage? Like, using a mouse? This section is only here because the mouse has a major flaw - which, by the way, may not apply to you. I am using a regular white IKEA desk and all my optical mice work just fine on it, such as the Logitech G9x or the 2001 Microsoft Wheel Mouse Optical. But the DeathAdder (3500 DPI infrared) sensor just won't work. The cursor just sits there, or jumps around occasionally. The right-hand edition actually uses a different and newer sensor (which I assume would work on this surface) but it seems the left-handed edition is left behind. However: As a mouse pad is required for smooth mousing anyway, for any mouse, this might not really be an issue.
&lt;/p&gt;

[image top] 

&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Pros&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A real left hand mouse with properly wired buttons - one of the very few&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feels great in the hand&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good looking, but subtle design&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Cons&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Old sensor which does not work on all surfaces.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lighting and DPI settings on the mouse would have been better than having to install Razer Synapse&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pricey&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While not perfect, it's still a good product. Or is it just the only product? Still recommended though.&lt;/p&gt;

    <header>A year with the Razer Blackwidow Ultimate Stealth 2016 Edition</header>
    <readableid>a-year-with-the-razer-blackwidow-ultimate-stealth-2016-edition</readableid>
    <subheader>Mechanical yearly</subheader>
    <intro>[image fonts] Mechanical keyboards have been all the rage for  quite some time now (since the 70s?). One year ago, wanting to jump on the bandwagon, I treated myself to one. This although my regular $12 keyboard was working just fine, that a mechanical keyboard is rather expensive, and that I wasn't even very fond of the tactile feel - or noise - of a mechanical keyboard. But as a programmer, I do type a lot, and good tools would hopefully help me in my line of work. How it went? Read on for more. (Spoiler: it turned out well!)</intro>
    <content>&lt;h2&gt;Picking the right keyboard... randomly&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There wasn't much thought going into choosing this particular keyboard. I already had a mouse from Razer, and they have keyboards too, so I figured I could use the already installed and somewhat awful Razer synapse software. After seeing a couple of models in the shop, I went for the Blackwidow Ultimate Stealth 2016 Edition as the orange switches, similar to Cherry MX brown, were reasonably quiet and I didn't care for the macro buttons of the non-2016 model.
&lt;/p&gt;

[image keyboard]

&lt;h2&gt;Initial impressions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
After unboxing, I started wondering what I had gotten myself into. The thing was heavy as a brick. I was used to repositioning the keyboard on the desk every so often with a gentle push, which was impossible with the Razer. Instead, I needed to lift it using both hands. But enough of that, let's hook out up‚Ä¶ with possibly the thickest and stiffest keyboard cable ever made. I found it interesting that Razer had integrated not only passthrough analog audio cables into the braided cord, but also a passthrough USB cable. A better solution could have been a USB hub, which would have enabled more than just one port. But my biggest gripe by far was the fact that Razer apparently forgot to label the USB connectors. As I had no use for the passthrough cable, I only wanted to connect the keyboard cable. But it doesn't say which one is which so it was trial and error. Super pro tip: mark the correct cable with a piece of tape for later!
&lt;/p&gt;

[image cables]

&lt;p&gt;
Once properly hooked up, I played around with the very green lighting effect settings of the Razer Synapse software. And even though the novelty wears off quickly, the tool is quite flexible and it let me, for example, use dimmed light and then lighting up individual keys as they were pressed and slowly fading them out. Like fading footprints in the snow, except from fingers on plastic.
&lt;/p&gt;

[image fonts]

&lt;h2&gt;Months later...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One hope I had for this keyboard was that it would be easier on the fingers. Typing on a regular rubber dome keyboard requires each keypress to bottom out for it to register, but a mechanical keyboard of this type would register around halfway down. However, old habits die hard and I inadvertently kept bottoming out the keys. There is no dampening on the Razer, just cold, hard plastic - causing even more stress on the fingers. I got hold of a pack of clear o-ring keyboard dampeners, and after installing them, the problem went away. It definitely felt easier on the fingers, and the keyboard was much quieter, too.
&lt;/p&gt;

[image dampeners]

&lt;p&gt;
A couple of months later, I connected my old keyboard to another computer and was typing a little. It felt awfully mushy. And I realized that my way to type had changed; I wasn't bottoming out the keys anymore so lots of my presses didn't register. Had I been using that thing for years? Back to the Razer‚Ä¶
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There was a note in the box saying "Congratulations, there is no turning back". And after a year, I think I both understand and agree. So would I recommend the jump from a regular keyboard to a mechanical one? I would say yes. But it may take time to understand why. As a tldr, here are my pros and cons after a week of using it, and a year later:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Pros (after one week of usage):&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keys feel different I guess??&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Pros (after one year of usage):&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Great tactile feel with slight audible feedback&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stays put on desk, doesn‚Äôt move around as you type&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easy on the fingers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Cons (after one week of usage):&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expensive (compared to a regular keyboard)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Heavy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thick, stiff cable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;USB cables not labeled with what they do&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No adapter included for the combined audio jack - cannot connect the good ol' Steelseries Siberia V2 without one&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Different fonts used for ASCII and (many) non ASCII characters (Scandinavian/Nordic model)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Razer Synapse is slow to start and always nags about updates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Cons (after one year of usage):&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OK, most previous negative points still stand, I just don't care so much anymore.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
And in case you were wondering, no, I don‚Äôt really type faster or more accurately. But it feels better!
&lt;/p&gt;

    <header>Android Works Surprisingly Well With Mouse and Keyboard</header>
    <readableid>android-works-surprisingly-well-with-mouse-and-keyboard</readableid>
    <subheader>OK, it was Sunday and I had nothing better to do</subheader>
    <intro>[image android-desktop] On some phone models, a broken display also means that the touch functionality breaks. As a last resort, some people have attached a wireless mouse to their device as a temporary solution. But why wait for the display to break before attaching proper peripherals? Surely a mechanical keyboard would improve the user experience significantly! With a poor man's docking station - a USB adapter connected to a USB hub - you can get that proper PC feel and still be using your phone. (OK, it makes no sense, but still cool that it works.)</intro>

    <header>Wall Mounting a D-Link COVR AC1200 Mesh Node</header>
    <readableid>wall-mounting-a-d-link-covr-ac1200-mesh-node</readableid>
    <subheader>Or rather, how not to</subheader>
    <intro>[image covr-ac1200] To get better wi-fi coverage at home, I recently started looking at getting a mesh system. With mesh, two or more units are placed around your house and then they will magically work together to produce perfect coverage everywhere. Each node typically also has a couple of RJ45 ports for connecting wired network equipment. I ended up betting on the affordable AC1202 kit by D-Link (same as AC1203 except with two nodes instead of three). I had originally planned to wall mount one node, and the guy in the shop told be this would be easy because they come with mounting holes - which turned out to be inaccurate. Read on for a simple method endorsed by no one.</intro>
    <content>&lt;h2&gt;Disclaimer (of course)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It goes without saying that suspending expensive equipment by the cables is not recommended! Please don't blame me if a node comes crashing down.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How to&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The unit has now stayed up on the wall for a couple of weeks and it is doing just fine. However, there might be a reason why the units don't come with mounting holes. If I ever found out, I will post it here - until then, at least I have decent wi-fi that stays mostly out of sight.&lt;/p&gt;

    <subheader>Google Play not playing around</subheader>
    <intro>[image google-play] I recently received a friendly e-mail from Google explaining that my game &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.regalraccoongames.tentinylevels"&gt;Ten Tiny Levels&lt;/a&gt; had been removed from Google Play. Excerpt:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
After review, Ten Tiny Levels, com.regalraccoongames.tentinylevels, has been removed from Google Play due to a policy violation. This app won‚Äôt be available to users until you submit a compliant update.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Luckily, I did get the app back in the store after a few attempts. Read on for the solution.</intro>
    <content>&lt;h2&gt;The complete e-mail&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi developers at Regal Raccoon Games,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After review, Ten Tiny Levels, com.regalraccoongames.tentinylevels, has been removed from Google Play due to a policy violation. This app won‚Äôt be available to users until you submit a compliant update.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Issue: Violation of Usage of Android Advertising ID policy and section 4.8 of the Developer Distribution Agreement&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google Play requires developers to provide a valid privacy policy when the app requests or handles sensitive user or device information. We‚Äôve identified that your app collects and transmits the Android advertising identifier, which is subject to a privacy policy requirement. If your app collects the Android advertising ID, you must provide a valid privacy policy in both the designated field in the Play Console, and from within the app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next steps: Submit your app for another review&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
1. Read through the &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/about/monetization-ads/ads/ad-id/"&gt;Usage of Android Advertising ID&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/about/privacy-security-deception/user-data/"&gt;User Data&lt;/a&gt; policies, as well as the &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/intl/ALL_us/about/developer-distribution-agreement.html"&gt;Developer Distribution Agreement&lt;/a&gt;, and make appropriate changes to your app. If you decide to collect sensitive user information, be sure to abide by the above policies, and include a link to a valid &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/113469#privacy"&gt;privacy policy&lt;/a&gt; on your app's store listing page and within your app. &lt;br /&gt;
2. Make sure that your app is compliant with all other &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/about/developer-content-policy.html"&gt;Developer Program Policies&lt;/a&gt;. Additional enforcement could occur if there are further policy violations.&lt;br /&gt;
3. Sign in to your &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/apps/publish"&gt;Play Console&lt;/a&gt; and submit the update to your app.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, you may opt-out of this requirement by removing any requests for sensitive permissions or user data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If approved, your app will again be available with all installs, ratings, and reviews intact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you‚Äôve reviewed the policy and feel this removal may have been in error, please reach out to our &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/contact/emailappeals?aid=com.regalraccoongames.tentinylevels&amp;t=9139962&amp;ts=BR&amp;email=$%7BEMAIL_ADDRESS%7D&amp;n=Regal%20Raccoon%20Games"&gt;policy support team&lt;/a&gt;. One of my colleagues will get back to you within 2 business days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please help us improve the developer experience by completing this &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScYSJsd99JFYRmybEPSdw508BVZwn2QS_tIGWx8PSbEiQgBfQ/viewform?entry.1019438846=9139962"&gt;two question survey.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for helping us provide a clear and transparent experience for Google Play users. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regards,
The Google Play Team
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Some background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This caught me by surprise. As far as I am aware, my app does not collect any data, nor does it have any ads, so assumed it was safe to skip adding a privacy policy. Turns out I was wrong.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I developed the app using Unity 3D, and it does seem like the version I was using (2018.3.12f1) made the application do something behind the scenes, using the advertising ID. The problem did also first arrive when I switched the scripting backend from Mono to IL2CPP in order to create app bundles but it might have been a coincidence.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The solution&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to fix this, we need to 1) Create a privacy policy, 2) Upload the privacy policy to a publicly accessible URL, and 3) Add the URL the the app in the Google Play Console.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Step 1: Create a privacy policy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are lazy like me, and also don't collect any sensitive data, a privacy policy generator such as &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://app-privacy-policy-generator.firebaseapp.com/"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; should do the job just fine.

&lt;h3&gt;Step 2: Upload the privacy policy to a publicly accessible URL&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my case, I simply put the text in a plain TXT file and uploaded the file to the webserver hosting the page you are reading right now. If you have a website, good - otherwise, you will need to find yourself some webspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Step 3: Add the URL the the app in the Google Play Console&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add the URL using the Google Play Console like so:&lt;/p&gt;
[image store]

&lt;p&gt;That's it! Your app should hopefully appear on the store shortly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Things to note&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It states in the e-mail above that the URL to the privacy policy must be accessible from within the app. In my case, this was apparently not necessary. Adding it to Google Play was enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, the best solution in my case would be if the use of the advertising ID in Unity 3D could somehow be disabled. It was suggested that opening the package manager in Unity 3D and removing packages related to advertising would fix the issue. I tried this but the app was soon removed again. Feel free to post a comment if you know how to accomplish this!&lt;/p&gt;

    <header>Rocket League Split Screen on PC with Keyboard and Controller</header>
    <readableid>rocket-league-split-screen-on-pc-with-keyboard-and-controller</readableid>
    <subheader>You'll never game alone</subheader>
    <intro>[image intro] Rocket League is a great game for split screen! At least for console gamers - the PC crowd was apparently partially forgotten in this area. While split screen pretty much works out of the box if you have two Xbox 360 for PC controllers, you are left hanging if you have only one such controller, or are using generic USB gaming controllers. Luckily, the TocaEdit Xbox 360 Controller Emulator comes to the rescue, enabling you to play split screen using the keyboard and one controller, and also adding more controllers as you see fit. Read on for a detailed guide.</intro>
    <content>&lt;h2&gt;Step 1: Download TocaEdit Xbox 360 Controller Emulator&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also known as x360ce. The program will emulate an Xbox 360 controller and also enable us to change what player the controller maps to. &lt;a href="https://www.x360ce.com/"&gt;Download from here&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;span style="text-decoration: line-through;"&gt;and make sure to click "Download for 32-bit games".&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Update: &lt;/strong&gt; As pointed out in the comments, Rocket League also has a 64 bit DX11 client (as of spring 2020). Make sure you are using the correct version (32/64 bit) of x360ce depending on the bitness of your Rocket League client.
&lt;/p&gt;

[note]
Pro tip: Read the system requirements first - refer to the page above. In my case, I needed to install &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40784"&gt;Visual C++ Redistributable Packages for Visual Studio 2013&lt;/a&gt; or the application would give me errors.
[/note]

&lt;h2&gt;Step 2: Locate the Rocket League directory and copy x360ce.exe&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First off, start Steam if it is not already running.&lt;/p&gt;

[image 01_browse_local_files]

&lt;p&gt;After opening the folder, navigate to the subfolder Binaries\Win32 - the RocketLeague.exe is located here. Note that in case of the 64 bit client, the path says "Win64" instead.&lt;/p&gt;

[image 02_copy]

&lt;h2&gt;Step 3. Set up the controller and map to Player 2&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Double-click x360ce.exe to set up the controller.&lt;/p&gt;

[image 03_create_file]
[image 04_start]
[image 05_map]
[image 06_2nd]

&lt;p&gt;We're done here, so hit save and close the program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Step 4: Play Rocket League!&lt;/h2&gt;

[image 07_ingame]

[image 08_3up]

&lt;p&gt;Good thing is, once this has been set up, there is no need to do it again. Just make sure the controller is plugged in and start Rocket League from Steam as usual, then join by pressing start. Have fun!&lt;/p&gt;</content>
    <images>
      <image>
        <description>To locate the Rocket League folder using the Steam client, right-click the game in the games list, select properties, and click "Browse local files" from the "Local files" tab.</description>

        <description>Switch to the tab with the same name as the controller. In the Map To dropdown, pick 2. This means that this controller will map to Player 2. This step is important, or both the keyboard and the controller will map to Player 1.</description>

    <intro>[image result-view] Unity3D allows you to combine 6 images to create a skybox to use in your game. Sounds good at first - but how can you create such images to begin with? Turns out the excellent Space Engine is able to export the current scene as a skybox, letting us capture stunning views of galaxies, planets, and everything else out there to use in our game. While some post processing effects are missing, it's easy and still looks great! Continue reading if your game needs a little splash of the final frontier.</intro>

&lt;p&gt;Space Engine might be one of the coolest programs ever made. It uses procedural generation to simulate a virtual planetarium, letting you just hang around in our solar system, or explore far away galaxies unknown to man. If you haven't tried Space Engine yet, stop reading now, get it from &lt;a href="http://spaceengine.org/download/spaceengine/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, play around with it and come back in a few hours after marvelling at the vastness of the universe. And while doing so, see if you can find any interesting views to use in your game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: In this tutorial, I will be using the older but free version 0.9.8.0 of Space Engine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Step 1: Find a view in Space Engine and export it&lt;/h2&gt;

[image spaceengine-view]

&lt;p&gt;Now, press ESC, select "Editor" and then "Export Skybox".&lt;/p&gt;

[image spaceengine-export]

[image files]

&lt;h2&gt;Step 2: Import the skybox into Unity3D and set the wrap mode&lt;/h2&gt;

[image import]

[image clamp]

&lt;h2&gt;Step 3: Create a material and select the images&lt;/h2&gt;

[image material]

[image assign]

&lt;p&gt;If you are unsure how to map the exported images, they should be set as following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Front (+Z): sky_pos_z.jpg&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Back (-Z): sky_neg_z.jpg&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Left (+X): sky_pos_x.jpg&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Right (-X): sky_neg_x.jpg&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Up (+Y): sky_pos_y.jpg&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Down (-Y): sky_neg_y.jpg&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Step 4: Set the skybox&lt;/h2&gt;

    <subheader>It works, but got quirks</subheader>
    <intro>[image large-webcam] Video conferencing seems more popular than ever, and is probably not going anywhere soon. An important component of video conferencing is obviously video, but the recent surge in popularity has lead to a shortage of webcams, and many have to settle with a poor camera or no camera at all. But fear not - if you happen to have a Canon DSLR collecting dust, you can pretty easily up your game with a heavy-hitting webcam. Read on for more.</intro>
    <content>[image large-webcam]

&lt;h2&gt;Getting Started (the easy part!)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will focus on using the Canon 600D (AKA Rebel T3i) on Windows 10.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, download &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=canon%20eos%20webcam%20utility" target="_blank"&gt;Canon EOS Webcam Utility&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; Unzip the file, and run setup.exe.&lt;/p&gt;

[image installer]

&lt;p&gt;According to Canon, after installation, you will need to reboot but that wasn't the case for me. Oh well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After installation, set the camera to movie mode (on the mode dial). While not strictly necessary, it enables you to control various camera settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, connect the camera to the PC using a mini USB cable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, launch you video conferencing program or video capture application and the camera should show up as "EOS Webcam Utility".&lt;p&gt;

[image preview]

&lt;h2&gt;Setting it up&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, if you want to do it properly, you may want to pick up a desk camera mount with a ballhead. I happened to have a small tripod that fit behind the monitor so I just went with that.&lt;/p&gt;

[image tilt_handle]

[image tilt_handle_replaced]

&lt;h2&gt;Comparison to a regular webcam&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also have an older Logitech HD C310 webcam, which is probably fairly representative of a typical office webcam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Logitech HD C310:&lt;/h3&gt;

[image Logitech_HD_C310]

&lt;p&gt;Some video conferencing software, such as Microsoft Teams, can apply background blur in software. While this works OK most of the time, it's still far from perfect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Logitech HD C310 with "fake" blur:&lt;/h3&gt;
[image msteams_fake_blur]

&lt;h3&gt;Canon 600D:&lt;/h3&gt;

[image canon_600d]

&lt;p&gt;So that's great! Quality is good and there is nothing to worry about then? Well - there are a few quirks, at least with the 600D. So now comes the hard part: All the things that the 600D cannot do, or does differently than a regular webcam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Adjusting focus&lt;/h2

&lt;p&gt;The 600D will not focus automatically, but you have different options for setting the focus:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setting the lens to Manual Focus and turning the focus ring&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With the lens in Auto Focus, press the shutter half way to let the camera focus. Tip: Connect a remote release, sit back, and press the remote release half way to focus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Note that focusing with the shutter, and changing settings on the camera, only works while the mode dial is set to movie mode. While in this mode, you may also use the shutter to take pictures and use the record button to record movies. Such images and videos will be saved to the memory card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Getting rid of the black bars&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might expect the resolution to be full HD (1080p), but the video resolution is actually 576p (or, to be exact 1056x702px). This is then padded with black bars to 720p, pillarbox-style. Some users have speculated that the reason for the low resolution might be bandwidth limitations of USB 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At any rate, if you find the black bars annoying there seems to be two fixes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Solution 1: Set the video resolution of the camera to 1280x720, 50 fps.&lt;/b&gt; This should magically crop the video resolution to 1024x576. Except sometimes it doesn't - I am still trying to figure out why. If the cropping doesn't work, try the second solution:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Solution 2: Use a virtual webcam&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By using a virtual webcam, we can apply cropping in software instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OBS Studio is a popular program that works as a virtual camera. It can, among many other things, apply cropping on the fly. Try this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download and install &lt;a href="https://obsproject.com/" target="_blank"&gt;OBS Studio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;.
&lt;li&gt;Close the video conferencing application that you intend to use. This is because OBS Studio must be started first, or no virtual camera will be found.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start OBS Studio.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the Sources window, click Add (the plus icon) and select "Video Capture Device". Select "Create new" and hit OK. &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the following window, select "EOS Webcam Utility" from the dropdown and click OK.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You should now see a preview. Optionally, check "Deactivate when not showing". This is explained below.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to File -&gt; Settings -&gt; Video and enter 1024x576 as the base (canvas) resolution. You can also try 1056x702 if you want to preserve every pixel but it's just a weird, non-16:9 resolution that may lead to some applications stretching the video incorrectly.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You may have to experiment a bit with the output resolution; setting it to the same value as the base resolution should be fine, but some applications (like Google Meet) seem to produce pixelated video unless it's set to 1920x1080.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Right-click the preview and select Transform -&gt; "Center to Screen" (CTRL+D).&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the bottom right, click "Start Virtual Camera".&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start your video conferencing application and select "OBS Virtual Camera" as the camera.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

[image obs-canvas]

&lt;p&gt;If you want the camera to automatically go into standby when not used, you can check "Deactivate when not showing" when adding a new video capture device, and then click the "Deactivate" or the eye icon. If you want to make this more convenient, go to File -&gt; Settings -&gt; Hotkeys and add hotkeys for showing and hiding the camera (look under "Scene"). Hotkeys are global so you can then enable or disable video from anywhere in Windows.&lt;/p&gt;

[image deactivate]

[note]
Expert super-pro tip: You can start the virtual camera in OBS automatically if you launch it with the command line parameter "startvirtualcam". Like so: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;code&gt;obs64.exe --startvirtualcam&lt;/code&gt;
[/note]

&lt;p&gt;Also, &lt;a href="https://splitcam.com/" target="_blank"&gt;SplitCam&lt;/a&gt; seems to be getting the job done but does not offer as much flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Things to note&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The built-in mic cannot be used for audio, so you will need an external microphone or headset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The camera will drain the battery quite quickly so you might want to get a &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=canon+dummy+battery" target="_blank"&gt;dummy battery&lt;/a&gt; in order to connect the camera to mains power or a USB power source.

&lt;p&gt;If you need to conserve battery, you can switch the mode dial to a photo mode (such as P) and the display will be turned off. However, you will not be able to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the shutter button to focus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the shutter to take pictures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the record button to record movie&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, the camera switches to auto exposure, meaning, among other things, that the camera will set the aperture automatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Should you be using it?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think one idea behind all of this is that a lot of users have found themselves in need of a webcam, or a better webcam, but may be having an old Canon DSLR at home collecting dust. If you are in that situation, downloading and trying out the utility is a no-brainer. Surely your colleagues and friends will be impressed by the crisp quality and smooth bouquet unattainable to regular webcams?? It's worth a shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in order to be able to use it as a proper webcam replacement, you will likely need to get a dummy battery adapter and a good desk mount, and also have a bit of patience setting everything up properly.&lt;/p&gt;

[image webcams]

&lt;h2&gt;Update: 2 months later&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I picked up a dummy battery and have now been using this setup for a couple of months, doing video calls pretty much every day. While it's a bit fiddly at times (switching the camera on and of, making sure OBS is running etc.), I think the improved image quality is worth it!&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some things I have learned:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Auto exposure is not great with this camera. Set the exposure to manual instead and adjust the exposure with the dial on the camera.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good lighting is still key. Take the opportunity to set up better lighting in your room!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I finally found a use for that vintage Revuenon 28mm 1:2.8 lens that's been sitting around for years.&lt;/li&gt;

    <header>Embed SVG Icons in HTML with PHP</header>
    <readableid>embed-svg-icons-in-html-with-php</readableid>
    <subheader>Just a way to use SVG on the web</subheader>
    <intro>[image svg-icon-editor] I have been using the font awesome web font for the last few years to add small inline icons here and there on this site, such as the arrow next to "Read the full article" text. It has been working quite well but I found that the style of the icons looked a bit dated and started looking for an easy way to use individual SVG icons instead. Turns out that even in 2021, the question how to best add SVG icons to a website is still answered with "it depends". I found that using some server-side help from PHP gave me good results. Read on for details.</intro>
    <content>&lt;style type="text/css"&gt;
.icon-background-06e825f0 {
  background-color: #ccc;
  padding: 10px;
}
&lt;/style&gt;

[image svg-icon-editor]

&lt;p&gt;
TL;DR: &lt;a href="#embed-svg-icons-in-html-with-php-solution"&gt;Jump to the solution.&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Goals&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We obviously want to keep things as simple as possible while maintaining flexibility, and make sure that the end user gets a good experience. So my requirements boiled down to this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Should be able to style the icons with an external style sheet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to select any icon, not having to pick from a fixed set of icons, e.g. Font Awesome&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No complicated workflow, no new tooling - just add the SVG and reference it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easy to use in code - just specify the name of the icon and that should be enough&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Icons should display quickly and without any initial flicker&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Technical options&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in order to display an SVG, we could use several options. The ones I considered were the &lt;c&gt;img&lt;/c&gt; tag, the &lt;c&gt;object&lt;/c&gt; tag, using Javascript, and inlining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Option 1: &lt;c&gt;img&lt;/c&gt; tag&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using &lt;c&gt;img&lt;/c&gt; is pretty easy. You just create a tag like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;code&gt;
&amp;amp;lt;img src=&amp;amp;quot;/content/images/search.svg&amp;amp;quot;/&amp;amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
And you should end up with:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="icon-background-06e825f0"&gt;
&lt;img src="/content/images/search.svg" /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
That seems fine at first, it works just like adding a regular jpeg or PNG. However, styles need to be embedded in the SVG itself, external style sheets have no effect. So we cannot, for example, easily set the color of the icon to the current color of the text. And that's the reason the icon above is black instead of using the color of the text. So no dice.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Option 2: &lt;c&gt;object&lt;/c&gt; tag&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar to img, you can use object just like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;code&gt;
&amp;amp;lt;object type=&amp;amp;quot;image/svg+xml&amp;amp;quot; data=&amp;amp;quot;/content/images/search.svg&amp;amp;quot; class=&amp;amp;quot;logo&amp;amp;quot;&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;lt;/object&amp;amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Result:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="icon-background-06e825f0"&gt;
&lt;object type="image/svg+xml" data="/content/images/search.svg" class="logo"&gt;&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
However, &lt;c&gt;object&lt;/c&gt; has a similar problem like &lt;c&gt;img&lt;/c&gt;. It can actually use an external style sheet but the CSS file needs to be referenced from within the SVG file. Since we don't want to edit each SVG before they can be used, this is not good enough.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Option 3: Javascript&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using a library such as &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/iconfu/svg-inject"&gt;svg-inject&lt;/a&gt;, we can use the &lt;c&gt;img&lt;/c&gt; tag and let the library load and inject the SVG files into the document. So we have the simple usage of the &lt;c&gt;img&lt;/c&gt; tag, but we can style it using CSS. Pretty neat! However, there might be a slight delay until the icons show up since they are not delivered with the page. Also, why leave something to the client that the server can do? (OK, that might have been sarcasm.) So that leaves us with...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="embed-svg-icons-in-html-with-php-solution"&gt;Option 4: Inlining&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So we end up with inlining as the only option. With inlining, the SVG code for each icon is simply added to the HTML itself. This enables styling using an external style sheet, and since the SVG is delivered with the HTML, there is no additional requests to load the icons - they are delivered instantly. But now we have a new problem: We obviously don't want to copy and paste the contents of the SVG every time we want to use it. PHP to the rescue! (Or whatever you might be using in the backend...)
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So with a function such as this, which reads the contents of an SVG file on the fly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;function GetIconMarkup($name) {
  return file_get_contents("content/images/$name.svg");
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can specify the SVG by file name and put on the page:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;lt;?php echo GetIconMarkup(&amp;#39;search&amp;#39;) ?&amp;amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Giving us:&lt;/p&gt;

[note]
&lt;svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-search"&gt;&lt;circle cx="11" cy="11" r="8"&gt;&lt;/circle&gt;&lt;line x1="21" y1="21" x2="16.65" y2="16.65"&gt;&lt;/line&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
[/note]

&lt;p&gt;As we can tell from the look of the icon, the color and size can, and have been, styled by CSS. Nice! And if we need more icons, we can download them, put them in the folder with the rest of the SVG files and just reference them by name. No complicated workflow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;So what about page size?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So inlining the SVGs in the HTML page obviously makes the HTML larger, and also, since the SVGs are no individual files anymore, they cannot be cached by the browser. So how much do the inlined SVGs affect page size? Let's use the start page of this site as an example. It has 9 unique icons at the moment that are used in several places, making it 26 icons in total.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Without any icons: &lt;b&gt;8,9kB&lt;/b&gt; (22,8kB without gzip)
&lt;br /&gt;
With inlined icons: &lt;b&gt;10,6kB&lt;/b&gt; (33,2kB without gzip)
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So gzipped, the increase is around &lt;b&gt;1,7kB&lt;/b&gt; for the 26 icons. The version of Font Awesome I was using previously was &lt;b&gt;7,4kB&lt;/b&gt; gzipped. Granted, Font Awesome would be cached by the browser and reused when navigating around, saving data over time - although the first page load is slower.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Of course, adding more inline icons will make the page grow, but gzip helps a lot especially as long as the same icons are reused. In my case, adding the same icon 1000 times only increased the page size by 4kB, even though it increased by more than 300kB without gzip. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy SVGing!&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <header>Removing jQuery</header>
    <readableid>removing-jquery</readableid>
    <subheader>Because everyone likes vanilla</subheader>
    <intro>[image remove-jquery] In 2006, jQuery was released. It was quite a game changer, providing a terse syntax that allowed for quick front-end development, resulting in scripts that behaved consistently across browsers - in a time when Internet Explorer 6 was still king.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward 15 years, and jQuery is used by millions of web sites - paradoxally, in a time when web developers since long have considered jQuery a legacy library of the past. The browsers have definitely come a long way since 2006, and many of the problems that jQuery set out to solve may not actually be problems anymore. Modern JavaScript natively provides much of the functionality jQuery offers, and IE6 and the likes are long gone. So as an exercise, why not try to replace jQuery with plain JavaScript (AKA Vanilla JS) and see if that promise has come true? I did so on this very website and had some interesting findings. Read on for more.</intro>
    <content>&lt;p&gt;Hint: I will be referring to plain, native ES6 JavaScript as "Vanilla JS" below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Selecting HTML elements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Maybe the most used feature of jQuery: Selecting elements by ID, class name, tag name, and so on. Example:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;// jQuery
var myElements = $(".active");
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    The code above would return all elements that have the CSS class &lt;c&gt;active&lt;/c&gt;. The dot (.) means we are selecting by class.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    The native drop-in replacement would be:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;// Vanilla JS
var myElements = document.querySelectorAll(".active");&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    Or, if you only need to select a single element:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;// Vanilla JS
// Returns first match, or null if none was found
var myElement = document.querySelector(".active");&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    If we are selecting by class name, like above, we can also use (note that the dot is omitted):
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;// Vanilla JS
document.getElementsByClassName('active')&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Selecting by ID is also just like jQuery, using the prefix "#":&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;// jQuery
var myElement1 = $("#myElement");

// Vanilla JS equivalent
var myElement2 = document.querySelector("#myElement");

// Also Vanilla JS equivalent
var myElement3 = document.getElementById("myElement");&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    A difference is that in jQuery, the returned elements will actually be jQuery objects, while the native
    methods all return objects of type &lt;c&gt;HTMLElement&lt;/c&gt;. As long as we remove all jQuery code, this is
    fine, but if we need to convert an HTML element to a jQuery element (I hope not!), we can do the good old &lt;c&gt;$(element)&lt;/c&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Adding event handlers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    Typically, we use &lt;c&gt;jQuery.on()&lt;/c&gt; to attach event handlers. So if we want to add a handler that runs
    when a button with ID "myButton" was clicked, we can do this with jQuery:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;// jQuery
$("#myButton").on("click", function() {
  console.log("Button was clicked");
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    Without jQuery, the equivalent code is:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;// Vanilla JS
document.querySelector("#myButton").addEventListener("click", function() {
  console.log("Button was clicked");
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    It's more verbose, but does about the same thing. Not quite the same thing however, which brings us to delegated event handlers.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Event handlers with event delegation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    If the element that we want to attach the event handler to does not exist yet, we can still attach
    handlers to it using this technique in jQuery:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;// jQuery 
$("#dataTable tbody").on("click", "tr", function() {
  console.log("Row was clicked");
});&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This requires the data table body to exist, but not any rows. When the table is clicked, jQuery checks if the&lt;c&gt;tr&lt;/c&gt; (table row) element was involved and if yes, runs the handler. This means we can start with an empty table, fill with rows, and all event handlers will work as expected. We could also attach the event to the document body if even the table does not exist when the event handlers are attached.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    We cannot do this natively, but a rather simple utility function does the trick (&lt;a target="_blank"
        href="https://carlanderson.xyz/adding-event-listeners-to-dynamic-content-with-event-delegation/"&gt;original source&lt;/a&gt;):
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;// Vanilla JS utility function for event delegation
function createDelegatedEventListener(selector, handler) {
  return function (event) {
    if (event.target.matches(selector) || event.target.closest(selector)) {
      handler(event);
    }
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    We can then use the function like this:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;// Vanilla JS
document.querySelector("#dataTable tbody").addEventListener("click", createDelegatedEventListener("tr", function() {
  console.log("Row was clicked");
});
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    So it works just fine - but I will admit, jQuery handles this really well and the native solution seems
    a bit clunky in comparison.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Adding the same event handler for multiple events&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    Sometimes we want to add the same event handler for when different events happen. For example, the code
    below adds an event handler that runs both when the user presses down the mouse button (typicall desktop
    computer), as well as when the user starts a touch (typically mobile device):
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;// jQuery
$("#myButton").on("touchstart mousedown", function(e) {
  console.log("Mouse button pressed or touch started");
});&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    While not as convenient, we can do this natively by a simple loop:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;// Vanilla JS
for (const eventName of ["touchstart", "mousedown"]) {
  document.querySelector("#myButton").addEventListener(eventName, function(e) {
    console.log("Mouse button pressed or touch started");
  });
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Adding and removing CSS classes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Adding and removing CSS classes in jQuery is easy. And doing it natively is just about as easy! Here we add, remove and toggle the class &lt;c&gt;active&lt;/c&gt; on the element with ID "myButton":
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;// jQuery
$("#myButton").addClass("active");
$("#myButton").removeClass("active");
$("#myButton").toggleClass("active");

// Vanilla JS
document.querySelector("#myButton").classList.add("active");
document.querySelector("#myButton").classList.remove("active");
document.querySelector("#myButton").classList.toggle("active");&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hint: Both toggle methods accept an additional boolean parameter that adds the class if &lt;c&gt;true&lt;/c&gt;, and
    removes the class if &lt;c&gt;false&lt;/c&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    Also, to check if an element has a certain CSS class, we can do this:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;// jQuery
$("#myButton").hasClass("active")

// Vanilla JS
document.querySelector("#myButton").classList.contains("active")&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Getting the size of the window&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    With jQuery, the (unit less) width and height of the current window can be retrieved by:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;// jQuery
var width = $(window).width();
var height = $(window).height();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    Getting these values natively is as easy and:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;// Vanilla JS
var width = window.innerWidth;
var height = window.innerHeight;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    Similarly, setting the width of an element with jQuery can be done like this:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;// jQuery
$("#myElement").width("100px");&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    This can be replaced by:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;// Vanilla JS
document.querySelector("#myElement").style.width = "100px";
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;AJAX/XHR requests&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    I have seen projects where jQuery is used for handling network requests and then not much else. In such cases, it might be attractive to look at the Vanilla JS alternative &lt;c&gt;fetch&lt;/c&gt;, that can replace jQuery methods such as &lt;c&gt;$.get&lt;/c&gt;, &lt;c&gt;$.post&lt;/c&gt;, and &lt;c&gt;$.ajax&lt;/c&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Here is a very simple &lt;c&gt;GET&lt;/c&gt; request with no error handling:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;// jQuery
$.get("/api/comments/1", function(data) { 
  console.log("Data retrieved from server.");
});&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the equivalent in Vanilla JS:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;// Vanilla JS
fetch("/api/comments/1")
.then(function(response) { return response.json(); })
.then(function(data) {
  console.log("Data retrieved from server.");
});&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that after we get the response, the body needs to be read with &lt;c&gt;json()&lt;/c&gt; (assuming the response is JSON).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sending a &lt;c&gt;POST&lt;/c&gt; request to the server, with error callback:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;// jQuery
$.post('/api/comments', data, function(result) {
  console.log("Data sent to server.");
}, 'json')
.fail(function(xhr) {
  console.log("Error sending data.");
});&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Vanilla JS, the code is a bit more involved. We both need a &lt;c&gt;catch&lt;/c&gt; for handling network errors
    (such as timeouts) and check &lt;c&gt;response.ok&lt;/c&gt; to make sure the return code is acceptable (we don't
    want server error codes such as 503!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;// Vanilla JS
fetch('/api/comments', 
{
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify(data)
}).then(function (response) {
  if (!response.ok) {
    console.log("Did not get OK code from server.");
  } else {
    response.json().then(function(result) {
      console.log("Data sent to server.");
    });
  }
}).catch((error) =&gt; {
  console.log("Network error sending request.")
});&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Fading&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fading out an element in jQuery is super easy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;// jQuery
$("#myElement").fadeOut(200, function() {
  console.log("Fade out complete.");
});
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without jQuery, we have a few different options. You might create a CSS class that animates the element and then remove it. We can also create a utility function that animates and then hides the element:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;// Vanilla JS: Utility function that basically does what jQuery.fadeOut does.
fadeOut = function(element, duration, callback) {
  element.animate({
    opacity: 0
  }, {
    duration: duration,
    easing: "linear",
    iterations: 1,
    fill: "both"
  })
  .onfinish = function() {
    element.style.display = "none";
    if (callback) {
      callback();
    }
  }
}

// This is how we call the utility function.
fadeOut(document.querySelector('#myElement'), 200, function() {
  console.log("Fade out complete.");
});&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was pleasantly surprised to find that I could indeed remove jQuery without all too much hassle. Much of the functionality of jQuery has simple replacements (such as &lt;c&gt;document.querySelectorAll&lt;/c&gt;), while other things should work with a minimal utility library (such as event delegation). Of course, the list above does not cover everything that jQuery offers and how to replace it, but in my case, this was all the information I needed to know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Would I recommend removing jQuery just because it's possible? That depends. The minified version of jQuery is around 30kB at the moment and is unlikely to make much of a difference to load times on most sites. However, it could be a good idea to stop developing anything new with jQuery and look at other options first. For simpler systems, Vanilla JS might just be the right tool for the job.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, I kept jQuery as well as jQuery UI on the old Icon Maker page. While it matters little in my case, it still demonstrates maybe the biggest hurdle: If you have built a rather involved app using jQuery, and especially jQuery UI, migrating away from that may realistically mean that you need a rewrite. As always, your mileage may vary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hint: When switching from jQuery to Vanilla JS, first check &lt;a href="https://caniuse.com/"&gt;Can I use...&lt;/a&gt; to make sure that the browsers that you are targeting support the functionality natively.
&lt;/p&gt;
