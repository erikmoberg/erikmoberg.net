<h2>Some links</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.cinemassacre.com">Cinemassacre</a> - also known as The Angry Video Game Nerd. If you like old school consoles and Godzilla, this is the place.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ytmnd.com">YTMND</a> - creativity at its best. Needs no introduction (if you think it does, don't click the link).</p>

<p><a href="http://henrikpettersson.blogg.se/">Henrik Petterson's blog (Swedish)</a> - a friend of mine, blogging about photography.</p>

<h2>The beautiful web of the late 90s</h2>

<p>Found out that some of the web pages my friends created long ago are still up. Worth a look (web design at its best).</p>

<p><a href="http://members.fortunecity.com/olle31/">Linus Nolheims Hemsida</a> - a product of the 90s. A fine specimen. This guy used to go to Vartoftaskolan, just like me.</p>

<p><a href="http://skyscraper.fortunecity.com/backstrain/87/index.html">lillen</a> - used to be my best friend forever. Lost contact some time ago. Anyway, if you search this site carefully, you will find some old pictures of me. Funny, eh?</p>
